  <h2 class='c008'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In the preparation of this book the author has endeavored
to avoid that narrowness of treatment which
so easily besets the writer on such a topic as immigration.
The effort has been made to regard immigration,
not simply as an “American public problem,” but as
a sociological phenomenon of world-wide significance.
While the primary viewpoint is that of a citizen of the
United States, several other viewpoints are considered,
and regarded as equally valid. It is pointed out that
there are a number of interests to be taken into account,
aside from those of the native American workman, or
even of the American nation as a whole. The immigration
question is set forth as a part of an inclusive
conservation program for all humanity. The modern
situation is placed in its appropriate historical setting.
Particularly, it is demonstrated that the popular notion
that a belief in restriction is inconsistent with sympathy
for the immigrant is false. The restrictionist may be
the truest friend of the alien.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the same time, this book does not profess to be an
exhaustive treatise on immigration. To deal with this
question exhaustively, as Dr. Leopold Caro has pointed
out, is too much of an undertaking for a single man in
a lifetime. This is for two reasons. In the first place,
the mass of data is too great, involving the intimate history
of most of the civilized nations of the world for a
period of from half a century to three centuries. In
the second place, the subject is highly dynamic. It is a
present movement, displaying aspects which are continually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>changing, and embodying relations which are
constantly shifting. The student is prevented by his
human limitations from keeping his information up-to-date
in every particular.</p>

<p class='c010'>For these reasons the purely descriptive features of
such a book must necessarily be limited in scope and
subject to inaccuracy. The writer is constantly constrained
to qualify his general statements in the effort
to avoid dogmatism or positive error. But the purely
descriptive features are, after all, of secondary importance.
The fundamental matters are the laws or principles
which underlie the great type of population
movement which we call immigration, and these are
relatively constant and unchanging. It is a knowledge
of these principles which fits one to understand the
movement in its ever changing aspects, and to grapple
with it as a problem of practical politics or sociology.
To define and clarify the concepts involved, to set forth
clearly the laws and principles, and to point out the
opportunities and responsibilities, is the chief aim of this
book.</p>

<p class='c010'>These considerations account for the summary treatment
of some topics, and the omission of others. Some
aspects of the question may seem to have received more
attention, others less, than their relative importance
would warrant. Thus the section on crises, exhibiting
as it does the intricate relationship between immigration
and one of our most important economic problems, also
suggests other equally detailed analytical studies which
might be made; as, for instance, the relation between
immigration and strikes, or child labor, or public education.
The discussion of the effect of emigration on the
countries of Europe, while dealing with a topic of equal
importance with the effects on the United States, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>manifestly only suggestive in character. Only such
tables have been included as are necessary for illustration
or demonstration. The statistical matter on immigration
is now so voluminous that it is impracticable to
include it in a treatise dealing with the general aspects
of the situation in a narrative manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some portions of this book have already appeared in
print. The section on crises is practically a reprint of
an article entitled “Immigration and Crises,” which appeared
in the <cite>American Economic Review</cite> for December,
1911. The discussion of the effects of immigration on
population reproduces almost <i>verbatim</i> an article, “The
Paradox of Immigration,” which was printed in the
<cite>American Journal of Sociology</cite> for September, 1911.
An article entitled “Some Immigration Differences,”
printed in the <cite>Yale Review</cite> for May, 1910, contained
matter which has been incorporated in different portions
of this book. To the editors of these three journals
the author extends his thanks for permission to use
this material in the present volume.</p>

<p class='c010'>The author wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness
to Professor Albert G. Keller, Professor Roswell C.
McCrea, and Professor Allen Johnson, who have read
the manuscript wholly or in part, and have made many
helpful suggestions.</p>

<p class='c009'>The study of immigration is a part of the study of
the dispersion of the human race over the surface of the
earth, but only one of the most recent parts. The
most important population movements by which the
habitable portions of the globe became peopled took
place long before there was anything which might
accurately be styled immigration. The dawn of the
historical period found the principal sections of the
earth’s surface already inhabited by races not widely
different from those now native to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the early movements by which man was scattered
from his original home to the four corners of the
globe we have as yet little definite information. It
seems safe to conclude that they must have resembled
the instinctive movements of animals more closely than
the rational movements of modern man. They must
have been gradual, by slow stages, and in immediate
response to the demands of the food supply or of the
changing climate. Such movements, which may be
designated by the term “wandering,” were the necessary
precursors of the more recent developments. They
furnish the background for the historic period, and
constitute the original factors in modern relations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>They may be taken for granted, and a detailed knowledge
of them is not necessary for an understanding or
investigation of such a historic question as immigration.</p>

<p class='c010'>The word “immigration” is one of those terms which
are in common use in everyday speech, and which
convey a certain general impression to the hearer, but
which need to be given a limited and specific meaning
when used in a scientific study. Many vague and
erroneous notions about immigration may be traced to
the failure of those using the word to form an exact
idea of its connotation. Particularly is it necessary to
distinguish clearly between immigration and certain other
forms of population movements to which the term is
frequently applied.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are three of these forms of movement. They
all fall within the historical period, and consequently
we have some definite information about them. They
may be designated as invasion, conquest, and colonization.
These, with immigration, all have this in common,
that they are reasoned movements arising after
man had progressed far enough in the scale of civilization
to have a fixed abiding place. That is, they are
definite movements from one place to another. This
distinguishes them from what has been called “wandering,”
and justifies including them in a separate category,
to which the general name “migration” may be given.
In using this term for this purpose, however, we must
rid our minds of the association which it has with the
movements of animals and birds. When we speak of
the migrations of birds we customarily refer to seasonal
changes of location, occurring regularly year by year.
They are not cases of a change of home, but of having
two homes at the same time.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Man, too, has his seasonal movements. It is a very
common practice of primitive men to move from one
location to another at different times in the year in the
pursuit of food, seeking a certain locality at the time
that a particular fruit ripens there, or a certain bird
lays its eggs. “The Haida Indians of British Columbia
annually voyage as many as 500 miles southward to
Puget Sound to lay in a supply of dried clams and oysters
for their own consumption and for trade.”<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c018'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Many
nomadic tribes follow the pasture from the lowlands
to the highlands, and from south to north, as the
seasons change. Even civilized man, in his highest
development, has his seasonal journeyings, from his
summer home to his winter home, and back. But
none of these comings and goings deserve to be included
as true movements of peoples, or to be called migrations
in the present sense. Migration involves an actual and
permanent change of residence. It thus becomes evident
that migrations can occur only in the most
rudimentary form among people in the hunting stage;
more developed cases may occur among pastoral people,
when they change their base of operation, as when the
Israelites moved from Canaan into Egypt, and back
after several generations; but in its most complete
form, migration appears only after man has reached
the agricultural stage.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since man, when he migrates, leaves a fixed home
in response to a rational impulse, there must be some
definable cause for the migration. There are certain
general causes which are found to underlie all migratory
movements, and which are worthy of examination. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>the first place we find that the cause of a migratory
movement must be a powerful one. Man inevitably
becomes attached to the locality in which he finds himself
placed. Bonds of many kinds arise to tie him to his
home. Among these may be mentioned family connections,
sentimental associations, familiar customs and
habits of the community, political and religious attachments,
business interests, property owned, superstitious
veneration for graves. All of these, and others, unite
to make the home ties very strong. The life of man is
closely bound up with his environment, and a change of
environment is a momentous event. As a result, there
is a marked inertia, a resistance to pressure, among
human beings, and the presumption is that people will
stay where they are, unless some positive force causes
them to move. And no trivial occasion will suffice.</p>

<p class='c010'>This force, which results in movement, may be a
very complex one, but in general it must present one
of two aspects—it must be either attractive or repellent.
Men are either drawn or driven to break the ties
which bind them to their native locality. The attractive
force must, of course, exist in the country which is
the objective point, the repellent force, in the existing
environment. This distinction is well brought out by
Professor Otis T. Mason, who classifies the causes of
migration into “positive”—advantages, satisfactions,
etc.—and “negative”—discomforts, compulsions, etc.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c018'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
In view of the strength of the “home ties,” however, it
is evident that the repellent type of forces must be much
the more important. It would have to be a very alluring
prospect indeed that would lead a man to leave a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>spot where he was contented. In fact we can hardly
conceive of a man deserting a spot where he was really
contented. There must be some dissatisfaction with
existing conditions to induce him to take the step. Attractions
often operate by inducing dissatisfactions,
through comparison. There is no attraction in a foreign
region unless it seems superior to the home surroundings.
Then the home conditions appear inferior, and there is
dissatisfaction. This is what Professor Sumner called
a process of idealization.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may be well, also, to distinguish between the causes
and motives of migration. Motives are subjective feelings
existing within the individual which inspire his
actions. They are the immediate forces which lead to
movement, and may be divided into the same two
general classes as causes. Causes are objective forces
or conditions existing outside of the individual, which
react upon him. They may exist in the physical environment
or in the human environment, and operate by
arousing motives, which in turn are the immediate
springs of conduct. Since human nature is everywhere
enough alike so that similar causes arouse similar motives,
and since motives can hardly arise without some exterior
cause, in our search for the origins of migratory movements
it will ordinarily be sufficient to examine merely
the causes. Thus in almost every case of migration we
are justified in looking for some cause of a repellent
nature, some dissatisfaction, disability, discontent, hardship,
or other disturbing condition.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c018'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>These discomforts may arise in any of the various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>interests of human life, and may be classified according
to almost any classification which will include those
interests. Probably the most satisfactory is the familiar
one of Economic, Political, Social, and Religious. The
economic causes of migrations are the earliest and by
far the most important. They arise in connection with
man’s efforts to make his living, and concern all interests
which are connected with his productive efforts. They
are disabilities or handicaps which affect his pursuit of
food, clothing, and shelter, as well as the less necessary
comforts of life. These are vital interests, and any dissatisfaction
connected with them is of great weight with
men.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is a wide variety of economic causes of migration,
of which the following may be noted. Permanent
natural inhospitableness of soil or climate or scarcity
of natural resources may make the struggle for existence
a perpetually hard one. Temporary natural
calamities, such as drought, famine, flood, extreme
seasons, etc., may interrupt the course of an ordinarily
tolerable existence. Serious underdevelopment of the
industrial arts may make life difficult in a nation by
limiting the productive power of its citizens or handicapping
them in the struggle for trade. A common
economic cause of migration is overpopulation. This
means that the population of a region has increased to
the point where, under the existing industrial conditions,
there are too many people for the supporting power of the
soil. In man’s struggle with nature for a time an increase
in numbers is an advantage. But there comes a
point where the ratio between men and land reaches
such an equilibrium that any increase in the number of
men means a smaller amount of the materials of existence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>for each one.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c018'><sup>[4]</sup></a> This results in hardship and dissatisfaction.
Many migratory movements, particularly in
the case of primitive men, or men on a low stage of culture,
may be very simply explained by overpopulation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Political causes are those connected with the organization
of government or the actions of the governing
power. In this case the dissatisfaction arises from the
failure of the individual or group to secure what is believed
to be a rightful share in the control of the government,
or in some positive repressive or persecuting
measures on the part of the governing body toward some
of its citizens. Hence we may look for motives of infringed
liberty, lack of freedom, or the feeling of oppression.
A bad government may put such handicaps on
the entire body of its citizens as to make life unsatisfactory
to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Where social causes of migration exist, the dissatisfaction
arises from some fault in the social organization.
Some classes or individuals are subjected to a feeling
of inferiority to other classes or individuals. A caste, or
aristocratic, organization of society gives certain classes
an advantage over others, and makes it impossible for
the lower classes to rise to a higher level. In case people
living under these conditions learn of another region
where advancement is possible, migration may easily
ensue.</p>

<p class='c010'>Religious causes include those cases where restrictions
are placed on certain members of the body politic because
of their religious beliefs or practices. There may
be actual persecution, though this is coming to be somewhat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>rare in modern times. The oppression may manifest
itself in various disadvantages, imposed on other
interests of life, but which are primarily due to religious
differences. The great historical example of this class of
causes is found in the case of the Jews.</p>

<p class='c010'>All of these kinds of causes may overlap, and almost
always two or more of them exist in conjunction. Cases
where social causes alone account for a migration are
rare. They are frequently, however, a contributory
factor. The economic causes are by far the most important
and universal, though we need frequently to
look for other causes back of them. Political maladjustments
often express themselves through economic or
social disabilities, religious differences through economic
and social limitations, etc. In any actual case of migration
it is probable that the motives of migration will
be due to a complication of causes. This fourfold
classification, however, is of great aid in isolating and
understanding the underlying forces.</p>

<p class='c010'>The effects of migratory movements, involving the
transference of bodies of people from one region to
another, are far-reaching and extremely diversified.
They concern both the country of origin and the country
of destination. They differ widely in specific cases, so
much so that it is scarcely possible to lay down any general
rules or conclusions which will be of value. They
manifest themselves under three main heads, viz. the
density of population, the physical stock, and the customs
and institutions, or mores. The most obvious effect,
and the one which is commonly assumed to follow any
migration, is a decrease in the population of the country
of source, and an increase in that of the country of destination.
But even this, as will appear hereafter, is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>by any means the universal rule. There is commonly
some effect on the physical stock of the country receiving
the migrants. This effect may vary between wide extremes.
Whether the customs and institutions shall be
also affected depends upon a variety of circumstances
which are likely to make each instance distinctive. There
is scarcely one of the vital interests of either country concerned
which may not be deeply affected by an important
migratory movement. But the factors concerned
are so complicated, and so subject to individual variation,
that movements which bear a general resemblance
may have very diverse effects, and each case must be
studied by itself.</p>

<p class='c010'>As to the routes or channels of migratory movements,
it may be said that in general they follow the lines of
least resistance, as determined by the combination of
all the forces involved. The closer the movement is
to a purely natural one, the more it will follow the natural
routes marked out by the configuration of the earth.
River valleys, such as the Danube in Europe and the
Ohio in America, have always been favorite migratory
routes. If mountains have to be traversed, the easiest
passes will be chosen, such as the Cumberland Gap in
the United States. In general, water has been a bond
and not a barrier between different lands, and the earliest
routes of distant travel were undoubtedly by water.
Greece became the source of numerous migratory movements
partly because of her extended coast line.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c018'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Having thus considered some of the essential features
of migration as a whole, it will be well to distinguish
further between the four great types of migrations to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>which reference has been made. One of the earliest,
simplest, and most natural of migratory movements is
the invasion. This occurs when a rude people, on a low
stage of culture, but with much native physical virility,
leaves its location, and overruns the territory of a more
highly developed state. It is a movement <i>en masse</i>,
involving the whole, or a large portion, of the tribe.
The tribe acts as a unit, and the end sought is the benefit
of the tribe as a tribe, not of any individuals. The forces
back of it approach the unconscious and irrational,
characteristic of wandering, more closely than in any
other form of migration.</p>

<p class='c010'>The power of the invasion lies in brute force and
numbers. It is a case of a lower civilization temporarily
overcoming a higher one—temporarily, because
the rude virility which enables the invaders to maintain
their own customs for a time succumbs eventually to
the enervating influence of a civilization to which it is
not trained. Civilization in the end proves itself more
permanent than barbarism. This result is often
furthered by the fact that the physical stock of the
higher race is improved by the infusion of new blood
from the very foreigners who are attacking it. This
effect upon the physical stock may be very profound
and lasting, as an invasion customarily involves large
numbers of people. But while the invaders may succeed
in checking the progress of civilization for a time, they
seldom leave any permanent monuments of themselves,
either material or institutional. They are not likely
to affect the language, religion, or social customs of the
invaded nation to an important degree. The mores
are more enduring than the racial stock of the people
who possess them.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>There have been numerous instances of invasions in
the history of Europe. In fact, the barbarian invasions
are perhaps the most important single factor in the history
of that continent during the Dark Ages. An excellent
example is furnished by the Goths, particularly
by the eastern division of that people. The original
home of this people was in East Prussia, near the Baltic
and the Vistula, where they were known in Roman days
as traders in amber. There were two principal branches,
the western or Visigoths, and the eastern or Ostrogoths.
Their physical and mental characters were well marked
and definite. In physique they were tall, blond, and
athletic, in disposition brave and generous, patient
under hardship, chaste and affectionate in their family
relations. As to their habits of life before their migration,
we have no very complete picture. In general,
they seem to have been living on the pastoral-agricultural
stage. They had no cities or villages, but lived in
scattered dwellings upon farms, which they cultivated
with the aid of slaves descended from captives. Much
of the land was held in common, and upon it were pastured
the vast herds of cattle which constituted their
chief subsistence. The powers of government were
centralized in a king, chosen by popular voice from
certain great families. They had progressed far enough
in learning to have an alphabet, but had not developed
any written literature.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is evident, then, that the Goths were a settled
people, and while the ties which bound them to their
home land were not very complex, and they were undoubtedly
used to long warlike expeditions, yet there
must have been some powerful motives to induce them to
leave a land where they had become so well established.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>As to the exact nature of these motives, and the causes
which lay back of them, there is no accurate record.
It is not probable that they were driven out by the pressure
of stronger neighbors. “Most likely it was simply
the natural increase of their population, aided perhaps
by the failure of their harvests or the outbreak of a
pestilence, that made them sensible of the poverty of
their country, and led them to cast longing eyes towards
the richer and more genial lands farther to the south, of
which they had heard, and which some of them may
have visited.”<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c018'><sup>[6]</sup></a> This explanation is admittedly largely
based on guess. But it has every element of probability
and marks the movement of the Goths as a perfectly
typical example of a migration due to economic causes,
natural overpopulation, augmented by temporary
natural calamity, arousing motives of dissatisfaction
through comparison with other seemingly more desirable
regions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whatever the causes, the Goths determined to move.
Uniting with the Gepids, Herules, and some other
kindred peoples, they formed a great throng, which
moved through what is now western Russia to the shores
of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Thence they
journeyed westward to the north bank of the Danube.
On the way they were joined by other groups of people,
of Slavonic race. Their real history may be said to
begin about 245 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, when they were living near the
mouth of the Danube, under the rule of the Ostrogoths.
For about twenty years they had been the allies of the
Romans, who paid them money to defend their borders
from the attacks of other would-be invaders. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Roman emperor, Philip the Arab, put an end to this
payment, thereby arousing the anger of the Ostrogoths,
who crossed the Danube and plundered the Roman provinces.
This was the beginning of a long series of invasions
extending down into Greece and Asia Minor.
Many cities were plundered cruelly and brutally. Fortunately
for civilization, however, the Goths had been
converted to Christianity in the meantime, so that the
army which finally entered and devastated Rome in
the year 410 was not the utterly barbarous throng which
had started on the journey from northern Europe.
Their leader, Alaric, was himself a Christian and did
what he could to restrain the natural passions of his
followers. Yet in spite of all, the sack of Rome was a
cruel and bloodthirsty affair.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is characteristic of an invasion that over two centuries
were consumed in the journey from the old home
to Rome, so that no single individual of those who
started on the undertaking lived to reach the final destination.
For nearly a century and a half after the fall
of Rome the Ostrogoths lived in or near Italy. Their
fortunes in war fluctuated, and for a time, under Theodoric,
they were the masters of the peninsula. Their
kindred, the Visigoths, were in the meantime settled
in Gaul and Spain. Finally, in the year 553, after repeated
reverses, the Ostrogoths retired from Italy to the
north, and as a people disappeared from history, leaving
scarcely a trace behind. The Franks were never driven
from Gaul, but eventually lost their native language
and became absorbed in the people whom they had invaded.
The Goths “have bequeathed to the world no
treasures of literature, no masterpieces of art, no splendid
buildings. They have left no conscious impress on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>manners or the institutions of any modern European
people.”<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c018'><sup>[7]</sup></a> Even Gothic architecture has no historic
connection with the people whose name it bears.</p>

<p class='c010'>Other barbarian tribes invaded Europe at about the
same time as the Goths, and during the succeeding
centuries. One of the most powerful was the Huns, a
people of rude culture but great virility, belonging probably
to the Mongolic or Tatar stock, who appeared
about the fourth century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> They were followed by
other races from the same general region and belonging
to the same great stock, the Avars who arrived about
555, and the Magyars who put in an appearance at the
close of the ninth century. The most recent explanation
of the migrations of these Asiatic tribes is that their
habitat suffered a change of climate from one of those
great cycles about which we are beginning to have some
information, which resulted in drying up the region, and
furnishing a much smaller amount of subsistence than the
people had been accustomed to. This is overpopulation,
and furnishes another case of that great economic cause.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c018'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
Another powerful Asiatic invader was Timur or Tamerlane,
who with his Tatar hordes devastated Asia Minor
during the latter part of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p class='c010'>A conquest is almost the reverse of an invasion. In
this case the people of higher culture take the aggressive.
It is an overflow of civilization, of manners, of organization,
of government,—not to any great extent, of population.
Conquest occurs when a well-developed state,
full of vigor, sends its armies over the territory of less
advanced peoples, imposing its political system upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>them, and laying them under tribute, but not slaying the
people or destroying their wealth any more than is
necessary to secure subjection. It is an enterprise of
the state, seeking its own glory and aggrandizement.
The movement of population to the conquered territory
may be insignificant, and in this, conquest differs
from all the other forms of migratory movements.
Consequently the effects on the racial stock of the conquered
people may be very slight, and in most cases are.
The effect on the mores, on the other hand, including the
language, may be profound and lasting. Conquest differs
from the other forms of migration also in the fact that
the motives belong more nearly to the positive, or attractive,
group than in any of the others. It is energy,
ambition, etc., which lead to conquest rather than fear,
cowardice, etc. Many of the individuals who change
their residence under conquest are state officials, sent
out in the pursuit of their duties to the sovereign, not
because of any particular choice of their own.</p>

<p class='c010'>It scarcely need be said that the great historical example
of conquest is Rome. Her policy was to extend
her dominion by making outlying tribes realize that it was
to their advantage to acknowledge her sway and pay
tribute. So long as they did this quietly and regularly,
little else was required of them. As far as possible, the
native governmental organization was continued, and
simply grafted on to the great Roman stock, the native
officials being made subordinates in the Roman organization.
Roman traders came and went, carrying culture
and civilization with them, and exerting a powerful influence
on the mores of the provinces, but the permanent
movement of people from the central state was comparatively
slight. Alexander the Great was a spreader
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of conquest, though his early death destroyed whatever
possibility there may have been of his establishing a
permanent empire. The career of the British government
in India has many of the characteristics of conquest.
Native rajahs are, to a great extent, utilized as officials
of the British government, and there is no large migration
of people from England to India, save those connected
in some way with the government service, or
persons engaged in commercial pursuits, who maintain
their permanent home in England. But the influence
on the mores of the native inhabitants is great.</p>

<p class='c010'>The third form of migratory movement, which has a
particularly close connection with immigration, is colonization.
This occurs when a well-established, progressive,
and physically vigorous state sends out bodies
of citizens, officially as a rule, to settle in certain specified
localities. The regions chosen are newly discovered or
thinly settled countries, where the native inhabitants
are so few, or are on such an inferior stage of culture that
they offer but slight resistance to the entrance of the
colonists. For while the two previous forms of migration
have been warlike, colonization is essentially a
peaceful movement. The rivalry for certain favored
localities may involve the colonizing power in war with
other civilized nations who desire the same thing, but as
far as the seizure of the colony itself is concerned, it
requires slight military exertion. Colonization, like
conquest, is a state enterprise, conducted for the benefit
of the state, but differs from it in that its motive is rather
the commercial advancement of the state than its military
or political aggrandizement. Colonization has
often been resorted to, also, when a state has believed
itself to be overpopulated, and has aimed directly at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>improving the condition of its citizens, both those who
go and those who are left,—something that is scarcely
dreamed of under conquest. Several classifications of
colonies have been made. The most satisfactory is
that adopted by Professor A. G. Keller, which makes a
twofold division into farm and plantation colonies.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c018'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
These differ from each other so much in their essential
characteristics that it will be well to examine them
separately, before making any further generalizations
regarding colonies as a whole.</p>

<p class='c010'>This classification is based on the typical form of the
industrial organization in the colony. As colonies are
always new and undeveloped regions, the fundamental
industry is always of an extractive nature, almost universally
agriculture in some form, though it may be
mining or fishing. Practically all important colonies
in the history of the movement, however, have been
agricultural, so that the above division serves every purpose.
In the first place, it must be noted that practically
all colonizing nations have been situated in the
north temperate zone, and primarily in Europe. Outside
of this continent, Phœnicia and China are the sole
important representatives. These, with Greece and
Rome, made up the colonizing powers of the ancient
world. As far as modern colonizing nations are concerned,
the question is limited to the countries of
Europe.</p>

<p class='c010'>A farm colony springs up in a region similar to that
held by the colonizing state, that is to say, in the temperate
zone. Colonies of this class have appeared both
north and south of the equator. The requirements are
that the conditions of soil and climate be such as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>make the products of the colony similar to those of the
home state, and to render acclimatization either unnecessary
or very easy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under these conditions, a large movement of population
takes place from the home state to the colony, and
it is a movement of families. Men find it possible to
take their wives and children with them, and a normal
population is established in the new land. Agriculture
may be taken up according to the methods with which
the colonists are familiar in the old country. As land is
abundant and cheap, each man will prefer, and will find
it possible, to take up a piece of land of his own, and to
cultivate it independently, rather than to hire out his
services to any other cultivator. Consequently, hired
agricultural labor is almost impossible to secure, and
each man is compelled to rely on the labor of himself
and his family to cultivate his land. As a result, the
typical agricultural unit becomes the small holding, occupied
and tilled by a single family. The system is
further established by the fact that the products of
such a region are well adapted to this form of culture.
This is the typical “farm” organization which gives its
name to this class of colony.</p>

<p class='c010'>Plantation colonies, on the other hand, arise in regions
different in climate from the home state, that is, in tropical
or subtropical regions. Here conditions of soil and
climate are such that the natural products are of a kind
which cannot be raised under home conditions, and hence
are luxuries rather than staples. Acclimatization is
practically impossible for men, and almost wholly so for
women, so that normal family life is precluded for the
colonist. Furthermore, as it is impossible for natives of
the temperate zone to engage in agricultural labor in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>tropics, for physiological reasons, all work of that kind
must be performed by the natives, or by other similar
races imported for the purpose. As a rule, the natives do
not wish to work, and wages are no sufficient inducement.
Hence they must be made to work, and slavery, either
openly or in one of its disguised forms, appears. Since a
very small number of Europeans will suffice to direct the
activities of a large number of natives, the movement of
population from the home state is small, and we find
agriculture in the tropics developing along the line of a
large unit, producing a single commodity, and operated
by compulsory labor, under conditions of waste and exploitation.
This is the typical “plantation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus we see that the social and industrial conditions
are diametrically opposed in the two forms of colony.
In the farm colony we have a vigorous population,
similar in stock to that of the home state, each family
tilling its own piece of land, and largely self-supporting.
Under such conditions large families are an economic
advantage, and population grows rapidly. In the plantation
colony the colonists are few and mostly males, who
superintend the cultivation of large estates, with the
purpose of making as much money as possible and getting
back to the home land at the earliest possible moment.
As far as the population of the colony is affected, it is
mainly by the growth of a body of half-breeds, who are
always a troublesome class. Morals are low, and life
unhealthy and artificial. In the political interests of
the colonies similar distinctions exist. Life in a farm
colony tends to develop enterprise, independence, and
political and social equality. A feeling of patriotism
toward the colony, as distinguished from the home state,
inevitably develops. The manifest destiny of the farm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>colony is to become an independent state, either with a
wholly separate government, or with only the most
tenuous ties binding it to the home authority. In the
plantation colony life develops along an aristocratic
groove, with well-defined social and political classes.
There is no love on the part of the colonist for the colony
as such, and no body of local feeling grows up among the
colonists. This development is furthered by the customary
action of the central government, which regards
the farm colony as of little importance because of the
similarity between its products and her own, but devotes
an enormous attention to the plantation colony because
of the apparent importance of its unique products.
Hence the farm colony is left free to develop along
natural lines, while the plantation colony is subjected
to all sorts of artificial restrictions and limitations which
hamper its growth. As a result of all these factors, the
plantation colony seldom achieves its independence,
but remains subject to the home state indefinitely.
Examples of farm colonies are the Thirteen Colonies,
Canada, New Zealand, etc.; of plantation colonies,
Java, Jamaica, Brazil under the Portuguese, etc. As
will be seen, the farm colony has a peculiarly intimate
relation with immigration movements.</p>

<p class='c010'>This preliminary survey of the earlier forms of migration
prepares the way for a clear understanding of the
characteristic features of the fourth form. This is immigration,
which in many respects differs from any
other population movement. These distinctions merit
emphasis.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the first place, both of the two states concerned in
an immigration movement are well established, and on
approximately the same stage of civilization. Immigration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>can take place only over what Professor Sumner
calls a single culture-area. Secondly, immigration is a
distinctly individual undertaking. States may direct,
control, regulate, or encourage immigration, but the
motives which lead men into this form of movement
are strictly individual ones, and the causes which arouse
these motives are conditions which react upon the individual
alone. The end sought is neither the advantage
of the country of origin, nor of the country of destination,
but the improvement of the condition of the individual.</p>

<p class='c010'>The two countries concerned in an immigration movement
resemble each other not only in the stage of culture
but in climatic conditions and circumstances of
life. There has never been any immigration between the
temperate zones and the tropics, in either direction, nor
have the polar regions ever figured. In fact, practically
all immigration, historically speaking, has been between
different countries in the temperate zone. But while
there are these resemblances between the countries concerned,
there must also always be some differences, otherwise
there would be no motive for movement. The
first and primary difference between the two countries
is that the one which receives the stream of immigration
is newer, and therefore much less thickly settled, than the
other. Other things being equal, the chances for a comfortable
living are greater in a country where the ratio
between men and land is still low. This ratio between
men and land is of extreme importance, and ought never
to be neglected in the discussion of any sociological or
economic problem.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c018'><sup>[10]</sup></a> It is especially vital as regards
migrations, which are so directly connected with the
shifting of populations.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Other differences which may be looked for between the
two countries concerned in an immigration movement
are the following: the country of destination is more
democratic than the other, and its people enjoy greater
social and political equality; there is more of individual
freedom of conduct, and fewer traditional or legal restraints;
military burdens are lighter, and there is
greater latitude for religious belief and practice. On the
other hand, life in the new country is likely to be more
arduous, industry more insistent, the demands for
personal ability more urgent. These features at once
suggest those typical of the farm colony, and in point of
fact we find that practically all countries which receive
large streams of immigrants are developed farm colonies.
These are, at the present time, the United States, Canada,
Argentina, Australia, South Africa, and to a certain extent
parts of Asiatic Russia.</p>

<p class='c010'>The requirements, then, for an immigration movement
are the following: two well-developed countries,
one old and densely populated, the other new and thinly
settled, the two on friendly, or at least peaceable, terms
with each other. For immigration, even more than
colonization, is a phenomenon of peace. On the part of
the people who are to take part in the movement a high
degree of civilization is demanded. They must be
trained to act on individual initiative, and must have
sufficient personal enterprise to undertake a weighty
venture without an official or state backing. They must
have sufficient intelligence to know about the objective
point, and sufficient accumulated capital to enable
them to get there. There must be adequate, easy, and
inexpensive means of transportation between the two
countries, in order to enable any large number of people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>to make the journey. The immigrant is not in any
sense an adventurer or explorer. On the part of the
nations concerned there must be a willingness to allow
individuals to come and go at their own pleasure, without
any extreme restrictions or regulations. There must
be nothing of the old idea of the feudal bond between the
person and the land.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the above it appears that immigration must be
distinctly a modern movement. Scarcely one of the
foregoing requirements—not to speak of the conjunction
of all of them—is more than three or four centuries
old. Consequently immigration, in the sense in which
we have defined it, has existed only for a comparatively
short time, practically since the Discoveries Period.
Moreover, it seems likely to be a purely temporary phenomenon.
With the disappearance of the conditions
which differentiate the countries which are now receiving
immigrants from the older European countries, it seems
probable that immigration will cease, for as far as the
human eye can see, there will be no new lands to be
opened up for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c010'>In addition to these four chief forms of migration,
there are certain other less important forms of which
mention should be made to avoid any confusion. First
among these stands what may be called forced migration.
This occurs when bodies of people, for any reason,
without any choice of their own, are compelled to leave
a certain region, and go elsewhere, either with or without
a specific destination. A familiar example is that presented
by the Jews, who were expelled from England in
1290, from France in 1395, and from Spain and Portugal
in 1492 and 1495. The Moors were also expelled
from Spain in 1609, on penalty of death. Another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>familiar example is that of the Huguenots, who were
expelled from France at the end of the seventeenth century.
Such movements as these have usually resulted
in a nation’s losing the most valuable elements of its
population. The cause has usually been religious.</p>

<p class='c010'>A different type of forced migration has been exemplified
in the slave trade. In this case the migrants are
compelled by actual force to go from one region to another
specified one. The movement of the Africans to America
is a familiar example. The motive is the economic one
of securing a supply of labor at a minimum expense.
Still another type is furnished by the penal colonies,
such as have been established in Australia and elsewhere.
All these forms of forced migration are evidently different
in principle and in most of their characteristics from the
great types of migration which have been mentioned.
Their study is a subject by itself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Still another form of migration is what is known as
the internal or intra-state migration. This is manifestly
going on all the time in every civilized country.
It is only when it involves large masses of people, moving
in certain well-defined directions, with a community of
motives and purposes, that it deserves to be classed with
the great population movements. Then it may become
of great interest and significance, as in the case of the
great westward movement of the people of the United
States. It is evidently a wholly different matter from
the other forms which have been emphasized.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is, of course, also a continual passage of individuals
between all the nations of the earth, in every
direction. A permanent change of residence is frequently
involved. These movements, obviously, may not correspond
to any of the principles which have been laid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>down for any specific form of migration, and, if they were
sufficiently numerous, would constitute exceptions to
all that has been said. In point of fact, they are isolated,
scattered, and occasional. They do not rank in any sense
as movements of peoples, nor do they complicate the
discussion of the great sociological phenomena in which
we are interested.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER II<br> <span class='c017'>THE UNITED STATES. COLONIAL PERIOD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In taking up the special study of immigration, it is
necessary to bear in mind at the outset that the word is
to be used in a limited and semitechnical sense. It is
not always so used in common speech nor even in scientific
writings, and much confusion and inaccuracy not
infrequently result. Let us state once more exactly
what is meant by immigration. Immigration is a movement
of people, individually or in families, acting on
their own personal initiative and responsibility, without
official support or compulsion, passing from one well-developed
country (usually old and thickly settled) to
another well-developed<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c018'><sup>[11]</sup></a> country (usually new and
sparsely populated) with the intention of residing there
permanently. The same movement may equally well
be referred to as emigration. It is obviously only a question
of the point of view. The two words may be used
interchangeably without danger of confusion, if the point
of view is regarded. There is only one movement, and
one set of people, emigrating from one country and immigrating
to another.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c018'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>As observed in the foregoing chapter, immigration is a
movement which could not have originated before the
Discoveries Period, and did not, in fact, become a matter
of much importance until a century or so later. The
countries which are now the objective points of large
streams of immigration are, without exception, countries
which have been opened up since that epoch. An exhaustive
study of immigration should take up each of
these countries in turn, and examine conditions in Canada,
Argentina, South Africa, Australasia, and the United
States. The plan of the present volume does not include
so exhaustive a treatment; it is intended primarily for
American readers. The specific study of immigration will
be limited to the United States. This is the more justifiable,
inasmuch as the United States is, beyond comparison,
the foremost country in immigration movements,
both in point of numbers and of world interest. All
the fundamental principles of immigration are exemplified
here more fully than in any other country. To
the citizen of the United States it is a matter of the
greatest importance and interest, for it has to do with
a unique subject—the make-up of the American people
itself.</p>

<p class='c010'>The history of immigration into the United States may
for convenience be divided into five periods. The first
of these includes the time between the first settlement of
the North American colonies and the year 1783. This
date is chosen for the end of this first period because,
as Professor Mayo-Smith has expressed it, “At that
time the state was established, and any further additions
to the population had little influence in changing its form
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>or the language and customs of the people.”<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c018'><sup>[13]</sup></a> The second
period, from 1783 to 1820, marks the beginning of
national life. It was a period of small immigration, and
closes with the year in which federal statistics were first
collected in regard to the stream of immigration. The
third period begins in 1820 and ends roughly about 1860.
This period is marked by the beginning and culmination
of the first great rise in the immigration stream, by a
growing opposition to the immigrant, and by state control
of the admission of aliens. The period from 1860 to
1882 begins with the Civil War agitation, witnesses the
disappearance of state control, and closes with the year
in which the first immigration law was passed by the
federal government. The fifth, or modern, period is
from 1882 to the present. Other features which distinguish
and separate these periods will manifest themselves
as the periods are examined more closely.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is customary with some writers, as, for instance,
Professor Mayo-Smith in the reference above quoted,
to include all movements of people into the North
American colonies, previous to the Revolution, under the
head of colonization, and to call everything after the
beginning of national life immigration. The second part
of this classification accords with the definitions given
above, but the first part does not. For it will be remembered
that colonization refers to movements of people
from a central state to its dependencies, while immigration
is a movement from the territory of one nation to
that of another. The fact that the receiving region is
itself a colony does not alter the case. Hence, in so far
as the people who came to the North American colonies
in the early days came from a state to which the region
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>where they were going was subject, they were true
colonists. They were simply going from one part of a
national territory to another. But all who came from
any European state to a dependency of another state—and
there were a goodly number of them—were immigrants.
Thus, even in colonial days, there were both
colonization and immigration.</p>

<p class='c010'>In establishing this distinction it must be noted that
while the colonies were undeveloped as regards their
natural resources, they were highly developed in respect
to their stage of civilization and their advancement in the
arts. In this respect they were the peers of the most
cultivated European states of the period. The factors
which gave a primitive aspect to life in the colonies were
due to the newness of the settlement and the sparseness
of the population. These were, in turn, just the factors
which made them desirable to immigrants and colonists
alike.</p>

<p class='c010'>The truth of this position is further established by the
fact that this distinction was clearly recognized by the
early settlers themselves. A very different attitude was
manifested in the colonies toward persons who came from
the home state than toward those from any other country.
The former were generally welcomed; the latter were
regarded with suspicion, if not actual hostility. The
history of immigration to the North American continent
reaches far back toward the days of the earliest settlement,
and many of the characteristic problems and arguments
connected with the immigration situation were
familiar long before the Revolution. A familiarity with
these early aspects of the question furnishes many enlightening
comparisons and parallels, and is of great
value in correctly estimating the modern situation.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>The peopling of the North American continent by
persons of north European stock began with the formation
by James I of England of two companies of settlement
in the year 1606. These were known as the
London Company and the Plymouth Company. To
the former was granted the territory on the North
American coast between 34 and 38 degrees north latitude,
though these boundaries were somewhat extended
in 1609. To the latter was assigned the region from 41
to 45 degrees. This left a section of unassigned territory
between, extending from the Rappahannock to the
Hudson rivers. This was open to settlement by either
company, with the stipulation that neither was to plant
a settlement within one hundred miles of a previous settlement
of the other. Neither of these companies, however,
ever made any very extensive achievements in colonization,
and both gave up their charters in the course of a
few years, the London Company in 1624 and the other
in 1635.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before the charters were surrendered, however, settlements
had been started in both territories. In Virginia,
the province of the London Company, the first shipload
of adventurers from London arrived in the year 1607.
But twelve years of hard and painful struggle were required
to establish this settlement as a permanent and
self-maintaining colony. It is interesting to note that
at this time, and in this place, one of the greatest of our
national racial problems had its commencement, through
the introduction of a number of African slaves from a
Dutch vessel in 1619. The settlers in this region were,
in part, adventurers, younger sons of noble families, and
other members of the aristocracy who found it advisable
to leave England, and in part rather unworthy representatives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>of the lower classes. A combination of political,
social, and economic causes was responsible for
their coming.</p>

<p class='c010'>The settlers of the northern colony, in the territory
of the Plymouth Company, were of a different class
of the population. Their motives for coming were also
different, being primarily of a religious character.
These colonists were separatists from the Church of
England, who fled first to Holland, and from there came
to America in 1620, landing in what is now Plymouth,
Massachusetts. In this colony, also, the process of
settlement was slow, and there were very few arrivals
for ten years. In 1630, however, about one thousand
colonists, Puritans but not separatists, came over, and
settled in Massachusetts Bay. This was the real beginning
of the history of the Massachusetts colony, which
in time absorbed also the Plymouth colony. Once
started, population in this colony advanced very rapidly,
and overflowed into the neighboring regions, forming the
colonies of Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and the river
towns of Connecticut.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the meantime the Dutch were taking possession of
the unassigned central region. New Netherland was
organized under the Dutch West India Company in 1621,
and the city at the mouth of the Hudson was named
New Amsterdam. Sweden, too, was trying to get a foothold
in the new country and sent a party of colonists
to Delaware Bay in 1638. This was not successful,
however, and surrendered to the Dutch in 1655, so that
Sweden never achieved prominence as a colonizing power
in the New World. With the growth of the English colonies
in the north and south, this central territory in the
hands of a foreign power came to be recognized as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>source of annoyance and danger, and on the occasion of a
war with Holland, England sent over a fleet and took
possession of the whole intervening region, forming the
colonies of New York and New Jersey. In 1681 the territory
of Pennsylvania was granted for settlement to
William Penn, and thus the whole Atlantic coast from
Canada to Florida became a field of colonization, subject
to the English authority.</p>

<p class='c010'>The study of the formation of the American people
as a separate nation is of peculiar interest, because it
has taken place within a recent historical period, and we
can study the original elements from the time when they
first settled in the country. This is not true of any of
the nations of Europe.</p>

<p class='c010'>The foundation of the new people consisted of colonists
from England. They were the original settlers,
and during the entire colonial period they continued to
contribute to the growing population. In addition to
these there was the Dutch element, which became well
established when New York was a Dutch colony. Aside
from the colonists, there was a large and important contribution
from other European nations, people from practically
every country on the continent. These were the
true immigrants. The colonies which were most affected
by arrivals of this sort were the central ones, particularly
New York and Pennsylvania, and above all the latter.
This was due to their location, the attitude of their
proprietors, and the feeling and conduct of the original
settlers. The attitude of William Penn was decidedly
liberal, and Pennsylvania advanced in population accordingly.
Penn advertised his colony widely, and when he
came over in 1682 there were already six thousand
Swedish, Dutch, and English settlers there. Others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>came rapidly, prominent among them English Quakers,
Scottish and Irish Presbyterians, German Mennonites,
and French Huguenots. These religious designations
are significant of the preponderance of the religious element
in the immigration of the day.</p>

<p class='c010'>Throughout the colonial period this class of causes was
an underlying factor in most of the important migrations
to America, both colonization and immigration. The
Protestant Reformation, and the intellectual and social
movements which went with it, had a profound effect
upon the contentment of large masses of the people of
Europe, and made that continent a very undesirable
place of residence for many of them. That political
causes should have been closely combined with the religious
ones was inevitable, on account of the intimate relation
between religion and government, and the practice
of using political power to secure religious ends, and <i>vice
versa</i>. These two classes of causes were the prevailing
and characteristic ones during this period.</p>

<p class='c010'>The religious tolerance and freedom which characterized
Pennsylvania was therefore one of the chief
factors which drew immigrants of every nationality to it,
and it quickly became the most cosmopolitan of all the
colonies. Penn’s agents were particularly active in
Germany, with the result that in twenty years the
Germans numbered nearly one half the population of the
colony.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the beginning of the eighteenth century two currents
of immigration rapidly outdistanced all others in
numbers, importance, and the amount of attention which
they attracted. These were the Palatines and the Scotch-Irish.
Throughout the rest of the colonial period they
held the center of the stage in the immigration situation.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>The Palatines were so called because their original
home was in what was known as the Palatinate. This
was a section of Germany lying on both sides of the
Rhine from Cologne to Mannheim. It was divided into
two parts, the upper and the lower, from the latter of
which most of the immigration came. The position of
this country brought it into close relations with the spirit
of the Reformation, and large bodies of the population
became Protestant, both Reformed and Lutheran. The
rulers of the Palatinate, the Electors Palatine, swung
back and forth between Lutheranism, Calvinism, and
Roman Catholicism, and since each successive ruler
wished his subjects to conform to his religious views, the
miserable people suffered accordingly. Both of the two
great wars between 1684 and 1713, the War of the Grand
Alliance and the War of the Spanish Succession, had
borne heavily on the Palatinate, which had long been the
object of Louis XIV’s most covetous desire. The second
ruthless devastation which the country experienced
during the latter of these wars reduced the people to the
lowest pitch of misery and desperation. Meanwhile their
ruler, John William, was trying to force the whole of the
people back into Catholicism. “To the people already
suffering from the intolerable hardships which the cruelest
of wars had thrust upon them, this persecuting spirit
of their prince came as the last impulse to break off their
attachment to the fatherland and send them to make
new homes in distant America.” Thus began the great
exodus, from a combination of political and religious
causes, in entire harmony with the spirit of the age.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Elector Palatine resisted the emigration, and
adopted various measures to check it, among them an
edict threatening death to all who should attempt to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>emigrate. As usual, such efforts were powerless to
check a natural movement. The first detachment to
leave was apparently a small band which, after many
wanderings, settled in New Jersey in 1707. In 1708
a small company came to London and asked to be sent
to America. They were sent to New York at public
expense, and were furnished with farm implements;
nevertheless, they fell into want and had to be aided by
the colonial council. The next year about thirteen
thousand Palatines arrived in London by way of Rotterdam.
They were, for the most part, absolutely penniless,
and in rags. England responded nobly to the
burden thus cast upon her. Queen Anne allowed ninepence
per day each for their subsistence, and they were
housed in army tents set up in vacant lots, and in barns
and warehouses. This piece of benevolence is said to
have cost England, in public and private expenditures,
the sum of £135,000. Some of these refugees were sent
to Ireland, but large numbers of them eventually found
their way to America. A large shipment arrived in the
Carolinas in 1709.</p>

<p class='c010'>The largest detachment, however, was a body of
three thousand who arrived in New York, from England,
in the early summer of 1710. This is said to have been
the largest body of immigrants to have arrived in this
country at one time during the colonial period. They
have been characterized as perhaps the most miserable
and most hopeful set of people ever set down on our
shores. In spite of their poverty, they manifested a
stern and determined spirit in their fight for their faith
and home. To the shame of the New York colonists,
it is recorded that they were welcomed with privation,
distress, fraud, and cruel disappointment. They were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>cheated and oppressed by the heartless and rapacious
settlers, to whom their helplessness made them easy victims.
It was by such practices as these that New York
diverted many streams of immigration from her territory
to that of her neighbors, particularly Pennsylvania.<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c018'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The second great stream of immigration during the
colonial period was composed of the Scotch-Irish, who
were for a long time called merely “Irish.” Neither
name denominates them accurately, as, in the words of
Professor Commons, they “are very little Scotch and
much less Irish.”<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c018'><sup>[15]</sup></a> They are in fact the most composite
of all the people of the British Isles, being a mixture of
the primitive Scot and Pict, the primitive Briton and
Irish, and a larger admixture of Norwegian, Dane,
Saxon, and Angle. They were called Scots because
they lived originally in Scotia, and Irish because they
moved to Ireland.</p>

<p class='c010'>James the First resolved to make Catholic Ireland a
Protestant country, and with this in view dispossessed
the native chiefs in Ulster, giving their lands to Scottish
and English lords on condition that they settle the
territory with tenants from Scotland and England.
Thus about 1610 many people from Scotia moved to
Ulster, and from that time on were called Irish, though
there was only a slight trace of Irish blood in their veins.
It was nearly a century later that conditions arose which
began to predispose them to emigration in large numbers.
In 1698, on the complaint, from English manufacturers,
of Irish competition, the Irish Parliament, a tool of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>British crown, passed an act totally forbidding the exportation
of Irish woolens, and another act forbidding the
exportation of Irish wool to any country save England.
The linen industry was also discriminated against.
These acts nearly destroyed the industry of Ulster, and
aroused great discontent. Next the people were compelled
to take the communion of the established church
in order to hold office, which practically deprived them
of self-government, as they were unwilling to renounce
their native Presbyterianism for political ends. Soon
after, their hundred-year leases began to run out, and
when the land was auctioned off the low-living Irish
could offer higher rents than they, and consequently
they lost much of their land. The ensuing large emigration
was thus the result of dissatisfaction due to an
interesting combination of economic, political, and
religious causes.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is said that in 1718 forty-two hundred of the Scotch-Irish
left for America, and that after the famine of 1740
there were twelve thousand who departed annually.
In the half century preceding the American Revolution,
one hundred fifty thousand or more came to
America. They were by far the largest contribution
of any foreign race to the people of America during the
eighteenth century, and constituted a strong element
in the army at the time of the Revolution.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the time of the arrival of the Scotch-Irish in America,
the lands along the Atlantic coast were already
well occupied, and they were compelled to move on into
the interior. The traditional religious exclusiveness
of Massachusetts and the well-settled character of the
country prevented them from settling in the eastern
portions of that colony. Consequently they chose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>as their destination New Hampshire, Vermont, western
Massachusetts, and Maine, and most of all Pennsylvania
and the foothill regions of Virginia and the Carolinas.
They were by nature typical pioneers, and gradually
pushed their way into western Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. They were the one
race sufficiently unified, endowed with the spirit of
liberty, and scattered throughout the colonies, to serve
as the amalgamating force binding all the other races
into one—the American type.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c018'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>During the whole of the eighteenth century, up to the
time of the Revolution, representatives of these two races
continued to arrive in increasing numbers. The Palatines,
though less numerous than the Scotch-Irish, seem
to have attracted more attention. The general attitude
of the colonists toward these immigrants was one
of welcome, or at the least of toleration. This was
natural under the conditions of the time. It must
ever be borne in mind that the distinguishing feature of
the situation in this country during the colonial period
was a superabundance of fertile soil, rich in a variety of
natural resources, and a scarcity of men. That is, the
ratio between men and land was low. Hence there
was a great demand for settlers, and newcomers were
believed to be, and were, an asset to the community.
A certain degree of rivalry and jealousy between the
colonies, leading them to covet a rapid increase in
population, contributed to this sentiment.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the same time, there can be no doubt that there
was a decided preference for colonists over immigrants.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>This was partly due to a natural race prejudice, but it
was augmented by the character of the immigrants at
that time. Considering the nature of the conditions
which led to emigration from both Ireland and Germany,
it is not surprising that a majority of the newcomers
were characterized by extreme destitution. As might
also be expected from the frightful shipping conditions
which then existed, many of them arrived in wretched
condition physically. The voyage was long, the ships
were small, poorly ventilated, shockingly overcrowded,
and totally unprovided with adequate provisions for
sanitation, cleanliness, and culinary facilities. It seems
to have been the expected thing that a large part of every
shipload of immigrants, particularly of the Palatines,
should arrive in a prostrated condition.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is a record of one ship which made the voyage
in 1731 on which there was such a scarcity of food provided
for the passengers that they “had to live on rats
and mice, which were considered dainties. The price
on board for a rat was eighteen pence, and for a mouse
an English sixpence. The captain was under the impression
that the passengers had considerable money
and valuables with them, and, believing that he might
profit by it, he endeavored to reduce them to a state of
starvation. He succeeded too well, for out of the 156
passengers only 48 reached America.”<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c018'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>These wretched victims were of course thrown upon
the mercy of the citizens of the colony in which they
landed; Pennsylvania, and particularly Philadelphia,
were especially subject to visitations of this kind. The
generosity with which these unfortunates were cared for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>in this colony is remarkable. Nevertheless, the burden
was a heavy one, and the opposition which arose to the
free admission of this class of persons is not to be wondered
at. A new country, struggling to subdue the
wilderness and to establish economic independence,
welcomes hardy and industrious laborers, even though
they bring little capital with them. If the poverty of
the immigrant is due to no fault of his own, and is offset
by a sound body and a determined spirit of industry,
there is every hope that the influence of the new environment
may set him permanently on his feet. But an
influx of people so deficient in moral or physical stamina
as to promise nothing, save an additional burden on the
already strained resources of the community, is naturally
and justly viewed with alarm. Very many of the
immigrants of this period belonged to this type.</p>

<p class='c010'>As suggested above, the low physical and economic
state of many of the immigrants was due to the conditions
and experiences attending the passage from the old
country to the new. Many an immigrant who was hale
and able-bodied when he started on the voyage was a
physical wreck when he landed. Many others who were
relatively well off economically on leaving home arrived
penniless. It was the practice of the “importers”
to compel passengers who had means to settle the accounts
of those who had not, and thus, it is stated, many
who had been well-to-do were reduced to house-to-house
beggary.<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c018'><sup>[18]</sup></a> But many other of the immigrants were
hopelessly destitute when they started. Still others were
criminals. It was the practice of European nations at
this time to empty not only their almshouses, but their
jails, into their own colonies, or those of other nations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Thus many of the colonists, as well as of the immigrants,
belonged to the pauper and criminal classes.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c018'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>This action of European states was naturally bitterly
complained of by the colonies. But as long as they were
colonies, and had no independent standing, it could be
little more than a complaint.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c018'><sup>[20]</sup></a> After the War of the
Revolution it became a matter of international relations,
and, as will appear later, attracted no little attention.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pennsylvania, being the destination of the largest
number of immigrants, suffered most from troubles of
this sort. Consequently, in this colony we find the most
powerful body of opinion contrary to the free admission
of aliens, and the most frequent and stringent measures
to control it. Many of the stock arguments against
immigration on the grounds of pauperism, criminality,
and inability for self-support developed during this
period.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the earliest Pennsylvania statutes covering
this ground was an act passed in 1722, imposing a tax
on every criminal landed, and making the shipowner responsible
for the good conduct of his passengers.<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c018'><sup>[21]</sup></a> This
was followed by numerous other laws designed to help
control the immigration situation. One of the most
important of these was the act of September 21, 1727,
which was passed at the suggestion of the colonial governor,
who feared that the peace and security of the province
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>was endangered by so many foreigners coming in,
ignorant of the language, settling together and making,
as it were, a separate people. This is one of the earliest
instances of the use of the nonassimilation argument in
connection with immigration legislation. The act in
question provided that shipmasters bringing immigrants
must declare whether they had permission from
the court of Great Britain to do so, and must give lists
of all passengers and their intentions in coming. The
immigrants must take the oath of allegiance to the
king, and of fidelity to the Proprietary of the Province.
On the day the act was passed, an agreement was
signed by 109 persons, representing about four hundred
immigrants, who had arrived at the port and
were waiting to be landed. A pathetic touch is given
to the incident by the naïve statement, “Sundry of
these forreigners lying sick on board, never came to
be qualified.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This act remained in force for some time, but appears
to have been more or less of a dead letter, for the shipmasters
never seem to have had any license to bring
immigrants, and yet the latter were always admitted.<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c018'><sup>[22]</sup></a>
This law was slightly modified in 1729, and a tax of
forty shillings was laid on each immigrant. This is
an early instance of the use of a head tax as a restrictive
measure, for among the reasons assigned for its passage
we find mention of the necessity “to discourage the
great importation and coming in of foreigners and of
lewd, idle, and ill-affected persons into this province, as
well from parts beyond the seas as from the neighboring
colonies,” whereby the safety and quiet of the province
are endangered, many of them becoming a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>burden upon the community. It was asserted that shipmasters
resorted to deceitful methods in the furtherance
of the practice of bringing in convicts.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c018'><sup>[23]</sup></a> This accusation
was substantiated by an event which occurred a
short time previously, when “a vessel arrived at Annapolis
with 66 indentures, signed by the Mayor of Dublin,
and 22 wigs to disguise the convicts when they landed.”<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c018'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
The provision imposing a head tax of forty shillings was
repealed within a very few months.<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c018'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Through the discussions of this matter can be traced
a frequent conflict of opinion between the colonial
governor and the assembly. The former, representing
the interests of the Proprietary, was inclined to welcome
anything which tended to increase the population
of the colony at whatever cost. The latter, representing
the people, is concerned for the character of the settlers
and the financial welfare of the colony.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c018'><sup>[26]</sup></a> This is well
illustrated by the progress of the effort to secure an
immigrant hospital in Philadelphia. The erection of
such a building had been recommended to the assembly
by Governor George Thomas as early as 1740, in the
interests of humanity. But the house demurred on the
ground of expense, and several years of haggling passed
before a pest-house was finally erected. In the meantime
much difficulty was experienced with “sickly vessels,”
and a law was passed requiring all ships to anchor
a mile from the city, until inspected by the port physician.
If sick passengers were found on board, the shipmaster
was required to land them at a suitable distance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>from the city and convey them at his own expense to
houses in the country prepared for them.<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c018'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The house, on its part, made vain attempts for a
period of fifteen years or more to get a bill passed which
should check the overcrowding of immigrants in ships.
The ostensible reasons urged were mainly those of humanity,
and they rested on an ample basis. The degree of
overcrowding was frightful. It was stated that in many
cases the chests of apparel belonging to immigrants
were shipped in other vessels to make more room for
passengers, so that the immigrants had no chance even
to change their clothes during the long voyage of sometimes
sixty days.<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c018'><sup>[28]</sup></a> But underlying this there was undoubtedly
the desire to reduce the number of immigrants.
It was represented that whereas the German importations
were at first of good class, people of substance, now they
were the refuse of the country, and that “the very goals
[sic] have contributed to the Supplies we are burdened
with.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In the southern colonies we find much the same attitude
of welcome to respectable settlers, and fear of
criminals and paupers, with this difference, that as immigration
was slower into these colonies, more active
measures were occasionally taken by the colonies themselves
to encourage it. Thus in 1669 North Carolina
passed a law exempting new settlers from levies for one
year, and from action for debt for five years. But they
were debarred from holding office for three years.<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c018'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Maryland early experienced difficulties with imported
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>criminals. On account of the practice, which appears
to have been common, of importing notorious criminals,
the general assembly of this province in 1676 passed an
act requiring all shipmasters to declare whether they
had any convicts on board. If so, they were not to be
allowed to land in the province. Any person presuming
to import such convicts must pay a fine of 2000 pounds
of tobacco, half to go to the Proprietary and half to the
informer.<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c018'><sup>[30]</sup></a> On December 9 of the same year the lieutenant
governor issued a proclamation requiring all
shipmasters who had landed convicts previous to this
act going into effect to deposit a bond of £50 for their
good behavior. Any landed without this bond were to
be put in prison until the bond was paid.<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c018'><sup>[31]</sup></a> This is one
of the earliest instances of bonding shippers for the good
conduct of their passengers.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the other hand, settlers of good character were
regarded as very valuable acquisitions, and measures
were adopted from time to time to encourage their immigration.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c018'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In New England the immigration question was less
pressing than in either the central or southern colonies.
There was less need of passing direct restrictive measures,<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c018'><sup>[33]</sup></a>
because the religious exclusiveness of this section
kept away many who might otherwise have come. And
there was little necessity of encouraging immigration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>as the natural increase of the population was sufficient
to maintain an adequate number of inhabitants. In
fact, the influx of population from Europe to New England
was practically over by the middle of the seventeenth
century. It is stated that from 1628 to 1641 about
twenty thousand English came as permanent colonists
to New England, and for the next century and a half
more went from there to England than came from
England there.<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c018'><sup>[34]</sup></a> As a result of these conditions, the
population of this region was much less mixed than in the
other colonies. Nevertheless, it was a prolific and growing
population, and “overflowed into the other colonies,
without receiving corresponding additions from them.”<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c018'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In spite of this fact, however, a certain jealousy was
felt toward Pennsylvania, on account of the large number
of foreigners who sought her shores. This feeling
was expressed by Dr. Jonathan Mayhew in his election
sermon before the governor and legislature of Massachusetts
in 1754. While he surmised that Pennsylvania
might in time experience some inconvenience from too
large numbers of unassimilated Germans, yet he attributed
much of her growth and prosperity to their presence.
He was assured that the English element in
Massachusetts was already too well established for there
to be any fear of too great an admixture of alien elements,
and expressed the opinion that all measures to
encourage the immigration of foreign Protestants were
to be favored.<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c018'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>New York frankly shared this jealousy of Pennsylvania,
and, when it was too late, made efforts to attract
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>immigrants to her territory. Thus in 1736 Governor
Clarke caused to be widely circulated in Germany an
advertisement in which he proposed to give 500 acres of
land to each of the first two hundred families who should
come to New York from Europe. The measure met
with no great success.<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c018'><sup>[37]</sup></a> Possibly the treatment accorded
to the would-be settlers of a generation earlier
still lingered in the memory of their fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p class='c010'>In addition to the legislation against paupers and
criminals, most of the colonies had laws designed to
prevent the entrance of religious sects who were not regarded
with favor. The class most discriminated against
was the Roman Catholics, and the eighteenth century
found harsh statutes against them in the legislation of
most of the colonies.<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c018'><sup>[38]</sup></a> Virginia, and all the New England
colonies except Rhode Island, had laws designed to
prevent the coming in of Quakers.<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c018'><sup>[39]</sup></a> Rhode Island resembled
Pennsylvania in the religious tolerance which
prevailed there.<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c018'><sup>[40]</sup></a> Maryland started on the basis of
religious toleration, but did not maintain this position.<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c018'><sup>[41]</sup></a>
A prejudice against Roman Catholics soon manifested
itself, and occasionally found expression in legislation.
Thus in the Maryland statutes for 1699 there is an act
entitled, “An act for Raising a Supply towards the
defraying of the Publick Charge of this Province and to
prevent too great a number of Irish Papists being imported
into this Province.” The provisions of the act
required shipmasters to pay twenty shillings per poll
for all Irish servants imported, as well as for negroes.<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c018'><sup>[42]</sup></a>
None of these acts, of course, was absolutely prohibitive.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Among the settlers of this period there was one peculiar
class which requires special mention. They were, for
the most part, colonists rather than immigrants, though
some of them came from foreign countries. These
were the indented (or indentured) servants, or redemptioners.<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c018'><sup>[43]</sup></a>
There were two main classes of them—those
who were brought under compulsion, and those
who came voluntarily. Of the first class, many were
convicted criminals, who were sent over in great numbers
from the mother country, and on arrival were indented
as servants for a term of years. Under the barbarous
legal system of the day many persons were sentenced
to death for insignificant crimes, such as stealing
a joint of meat worth over a shilling, or counterfeiting
a lottery ticket. Many humane judges welcomed exile
as an alternative to the death penalty. It is estimated
that possibly as many as fifty thousand criminals were
sent to America from the British Isles, from the year
1717 until the practice was ended by the War of Independence.
Besides the criminals, in this class of indented
servants were many who were kidnaped and
sent over to America. Press gangs were busy in London,
Bristol, and other English seaports, seizing boys and
girls, usually, but not always, from the lowest classes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of society, and sending them over to labor as indented
servants in the colonies.</p>

<p class='c010'>Those who came voluntarily were respectable but
destitute persons who, despairing of success or progress
in the old country, sold themselves into temporary
slavery to pay their passage over. Many of these came
from very good classes of society. The southern colonies
received a much larger number of indented servants of
all classes than the northern colonies, as the semiplantation
character of the former made a much larger demand
for servile labor than in the farm colonies of the north.<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c018'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Shipmasters made an enormous profit from this
traffic, adding as much as 100 per cent of the actual
cost of transportation to cover risks. Adults were
bound out for a term of three to six years, children from
ten to fifteen years, and smaller children were, without
charge, surrendered to masters who had to rear and board
them.<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c018'><sup>[45]</sup></a> As a rule the indented servants, on the arrival
of a ship at an American port, were auctioned off to the
highest bidder at a public auction very like a slave
market. The last sales of this kind reported took place
in Philadelphia in 1818 and 1819. These were mostly
Germans. Many of the indented servants became
eminent and respected citizens of the colonies, while
others degenerated and became the progenitors of the
“poor white trash” of the south.</p>

<p class='c010'>As a result of this study of the colonial period the
fact stands out prominently that during these years
both colonization and immigration entered into the peopling
of the Thirteen Colonies. The distinction between
the two was clearly recognized by the colonists themselves,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>and immigrants were accorded different treatment from
colonists. In the handling of the situation many of
the stock arguments against unrestricted immigration
were developed, and some of the important legislative
expedients, such as the head tax, the bonding of shippers,
the exclusion of paupers and criminals, etc., which have
had a wide use in later years, were put into practice.
It is very noteworthy, however, that in all the discussions
of this question during this period one searches in vain
for any trace of opposition to immigration on the grounds
of the economic competition of the newcomer with the
older residents. In the unsettled state of the country
at this time, such a thing could hardly be thought of.
The idea of any crowding of the industrial field, or any
lack of economic opportunity for an unlimited number,
was almost inconceivable. It is this, more than any
other one thing, which differentiates the immigration
situation during the colonial period from that at the
present time.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two other fundamental facts in reference to the formation
of the new American people should also be noted
in this connection. The first is that the actual transference
of people from Europe to America during the
entire colonial period was relatively slight. Benjamin
Franklin stated that in 1741 a population of about
one million had been produced from an immigration
(used in the broad sense) of less than 80,000.<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c018'><sup>[46]</sup></a> As an
indication of how much less important this “immigration”
was than the recent immigration into the United
States has been, it may be noted that the ratio between
immigrants and total population, at the period that
Franklin mentioned, was one to twelve for a period of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>120 years or more, while the ratio between immigrants
since 1820 and population in 1900—a period of only
eighty years—was one to four. “After the first outflow
from Old to New England, in 1630–31, emigration
was checked, at first by the changing circumstances of
the struggle between the people and the king, and, when
the struggle was over, by the better-known difficulties
of life in the colonies.”<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c018'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The second of these facts is that such additions to
population as there were, while containing a number of
diverse elements, were predominantly English, and that
those who were not English were almost wholly from
races closely allied to the English. These were principally
the Dutch, Swedes, Germans, and Scotch-Irish,
which with the English, as Professor Commons has
pointed out, were, less than two thousand years ago, all
one Germanic race in the forests surrounding the North
Sea. “It is the distinctive fact regarding colonial migration
that it was Teutonic in blood and Protestant in
religion.”<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c018'><sup>[48]</sup></a> This Protestantism was important, not so
much because of the superiority of one form of religion
over another, as because of the type of mind and
character which Protestantism at that day represented.
It stood for independence of thought, moral conviction,
courage, and hardihood.</p>

<p class='c010'>The English element, then, was sufficiently preëminent
quickly to reduce all other elements to its type.
As a result of the character of the migration assimilation
was easy, quick, and complete. While it was said that
every language of Europe could be found in Pennsylvania,
this diversity was short-lived. “No matter how diverse
the small immigration might have been on its arrival,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>there was a steady pressure on its descendants to turn
them into Englishmen; and it was very successful....
The whole coast, from Nova Scotia to the Spanish possessions
in Florida, was one in all essential circumstances.”<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c018'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Such, then, was the American people at the time of
the Revolution—a physically homogeneous race, composed
almost wholly of native-born descendants of
native-born ancestors, of a decidedly English type, but
with a distinct character of its own. This was the
great stock from which the people of the United States
grew, and upon which all subsequent additions must be
regarded as extraneous grafts.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER III<br> <span class='c017'>1783 TO 1820</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>With the beginning of the life of the United States
as a separate nation, all strangers arriving at her shores,
whencesoever they came, are to be classed as immigrants.
From this time on colonization may be dropped
out of the reckoning, and all increments of population
from foreign sources be considered under the head of
immigration.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first forty-odd years of our national life are included
in the second of the five periods which have been
distinguished. During this period no accurate statistics
were kept of the arrival of immigrants. The federal
government took no control of the matter whatever, and
the records of the states, taken mainly at the customhouses,
were fragmentary and unreliable. Consequently
there is no certainty as to the number or source of the
arrivals during these years, and we are forced to rely on
estimates. The best known are those of Seybert and
Blodgett, which are generally taken as the basis of other
estimates. The Bureau of Statistics in its pamphlet
on “Immigration into the United States” (1903) says,
“The best estimates of the total immigration into the
United States prior to the official count puts [sic] the
total number of arrivals at not to exceed 250,000 in
the entire period between 1776 and 1820” (p. 4336).
In an unpublished study of this question Mr. J. L.
Leonard of Yale University finds this estimate probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>too small, and thinks that the figure 345,000 would
come nearer to representing the total number of immigrants
from 1784 to 1810.</p>

<p class='c010'>One thing is certain, however, that immigration during
this period was far from being a burning issue, or from
attracting any great amount of attention. An average
of ten thousand arrivals a year was not a matter of great
importance, and the young nation had enough more
weighty matters to engage her attention to prevent
her devoting much thought to immigration. It is true
that the need of an increasing population was still felt,
as it had been during colonial days, but the native
population was multiplying at an extraordinary rate
(doubling about every twenty-two years) and seemed
thoroughly capable of supplying the entire need.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet we find occasional references to the matter in the
contemporary literature, and the subject was evidently
one which frequently came up for discussion. In general,
foreigners were not regarded as such desirable citizens
as natives, and it was considered unwise to give newcomers
too much power or responsibility in the government.<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c018'><sup>[50]</sup></a>
Benjamin Franklin, writing in the <cite>American
Museum</cite> for the year 1787, stated that the only encouragements
which this government holds out to strangers
are such as are derived from good laws and liberty.
“Strangers are welcome, because there is room enough
for them all, and therefore the old inhabitants are not
jealous of them.... One or two years’ residence
give him [the immigrant] all the rights of a citizen;
but the government does not at present, whatever it
may have done in former times, hire people to become
settlers, by paying their passage, giving land, negroes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>utensils, stock, or any other kind of emolument whatsoever.”<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c018'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>A citizen of Pennsylvania, writing to a friend in Great
Britain, enumerated the classes which could profitably
come to America as follows: farmers, mechanics and
manufacturers, laborers, indented servants, followers of
the learned professions, and schoolmasters. “The encouragement
held out to European immigrants is not
the same in all the states. New England, New York,
and New Jersey, being nearly filled with cultivators of
the earth, afford encouragement chiefly to mechanics
and laborers.” Manufacture is said to be flourishing
in these sections. “European artists, therefore, cannot
fail of meeting with encouragement in each of the above
states.” Pennsylvania is said to welcome all people
belonging to the classes mentioned above as needed, and
the writer expresses his belief that the progress of art
and science has been greatly favored by the extreme
heterogeneity of population in that state, where, “we
possess the virtues and weaknesses of most of the sects
and nations of Europe.”<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c018'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>On April 20, 1787, a paper was read before the society for
political inquiries at the house of Dr. Franklin. The subject
was “An enquiry into the best means of encouraging
emigration from abroad, consistently with the happiness
and safety of the original citizens.” The author admits
at the outset that it is a question how much encouragement
ought to be given to immigration. There seems
to be a need for an increase of population. On the
other hand, we have a right to restrict immigration whenever
it appears likely to prove hurtful. Some prudent
men have a well-grounded fear of the harm which may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>result from admitting foreigners too freely into participation
in the rights of citizenship. Foreign powers might
take advantage of such concessions to accomplish injury
to the nation. The author doubts the validity of these
fears, especially when it is considered that the usual
motive for emigration is dissatisfaction with the old
country.</p>

<p class='c010'>The author reverts to the old question of imported
criminals, remarking, “With a most preposterous
policy, the former masters of this country were accustomed
to discharge their jails of the violent part of
their subjects, and to transmit shiploads of wretches,
too worthless for the old world, to taint and corrupt the
infancy of the new.” With a somewhat unwarranted
optimism he adds, “It is not now likely that these states
will be insulted with transportations of this sort, directly
ordered from any other sovereign power.” Pennsylvania
seems to be the only state which appears sensible
of the danger from the poor quality of citizens. Referring
to acts which have already been noted, the author
says that Pennsylvania requires her naturalized citizens
to be of good character, as far as this can be determined,
and also remarks, “Pennsylvania, swelling hourly with
arrivals of honest, industrious Germans and others,
wisely discouraged by a duty, what she dared not openly
prohibit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The conclusion of the whole matter is that “the best
means of encouraging emigration may therefore be truly
said to be the cultivation of industry and virtue among
ourselves, and the establishment of wholesome laws upon
permanent foundations, which may render the comforts
we enjoy objects of desire and pursuit to others.”<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c018'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>The foregoing quotations may be taken as representative
of the prevailing attitude toward immigration
among the body of the American people. It is noteworthy
that there is still no fear of the economic competition
of the immigrants, though there is a faint foreshadowing
of such a condition in the preference expressed
for “artists” as against agriculturists, of which there
already seemed to be enough in some states. On the
whole, however, immigrants were regarded as assets,
and there existed a vigorous sentiment in favor of encouraging
them to come.</p>

<p class='c010'>This sentiment occasionally found more active expression
than that recommended in the passage quoted.
North Carolina, for instance, by an act of the general
assembly, passed in 1790, granted to Henry Emmanuel
Lutterloh the right to raise $6000 per year for five
years by lottery, for the purpose of introducing foreign
artisans.<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c018'><sup>[54]</sup></a> <cite>Niles’ Register</cite> for November 9, 1816, states
that “Col. Nicholas Gray, after having consulted with
the governor of the Mississippi territory, is authorized
to invite any number of industrious emigrants into that
country, where they will be provided with lands, <i>rent
free</i> for three years, and with cattle and corn at the usual
rates.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The fear of foreign influence on our politics, to which
reference has been made above, grew stronger during
the next decade, and finally led to the passage of the
Alien Bill in 1798, by which the president was empowered
to deport all aliens whom he regarded as
dangerous to the country. This act was a result of transitory
unsettled conditions, particularly the expectation
of a war with France, and contained a proviso that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>it should expire two years after passage. But it contains
an important permanent principle—that of the right
of deportation—which has been made much of in
recent years.</p>

<p class='c010'>The discussion of the question of naturalization
brought out some decided opinions on both sides of the
immigration problem.<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c018'><sup>[55]</sup></a> The period of residence required
for naturalization was set at two years by the
act of 1790, but this was raised to five years in 1795.
The war excitement which marked the closing years of
the century led to the passage of an act in 1798 requiring
a residence of fourteen years for naturalization. This
was repealed after four years, and the provisions of the
act of 1795 were again put in force. They have remained
unchanged in their essentials ever since. In
addition to the period of residence required, there was
much discussion as to the charge to be made for naturalization.
It was proposed by some to set this at $20,
but this was regarded by others as too high, and the
amount was finally fixed at $5.<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c018'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>There was little change in the attitude toward immigration
during the following years up to 1820. The
number of arrivals remained relatively small. The
immigrants, being mainly from Germany and the United
Kingdom, were readily assimilated. In 1809 a French
immigrant wrote a letter from Boston in which he said,
“There is in general no enmity to strangers as such, but
the most open, unguarded hospitality.”<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c018'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Shipping conditions were still very bad. We are
told that in 1818 one ship from Amsterdam embarked
about eleven hundred persons for America. Out of these,
about five hundred died, some of them before leaving the
shores of Europe.<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c018'><sup>[58]</sup></a> Some ships seem to have followed
the practice of sailing from Europe with a cargo of
passengers, ostensibly for America, but instead of
following this course, stopping at some near-by island,
compelling their passengers to disembark, and then
going back to the mainland for a fresh load. It follows,
of course, that a large part of the immigrants who finally
reached America arrived in a most deplorable condition.</p>

<p class='c010'>During this period there occurred some important
events which had the effect temporarily of interfering
with the stream of immigration, but in their after results
were largely responsible for conditions which gave to
immigration an impetus such as it had never had before.
Foremost among these were the Orders in Council, the
Embargo, and the War of 1812. These great events
resulted in powerfully stimulating the manufacturing
industries of the United States. Up to this time, shipping
and commerce had been among the most important,
if not actually the leading, forms of enterprise for the
citizens of the new nation, aside from agriculture. The
Embargo, with the other restrictive conditions, struck a
severe blow at this branch of industry, and forced great
numbers of Americans to devote their energies to other
forms of enterprise, notably manufacturing.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the same time the need for such native manufactures
was vastly augmented by the discontinuance of
the supplies from England. This forced the youthful
nation to be more self-sufficient and independent than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>she had ever been before. At the close of the period of
interrupted communication, England tried to dump the
goods which had accumulated in her warehouses for a
number of years upon the American market at cut prices.
At this the Americans rebelled. They had had a taste
of independence and liked it, and in the protection of
their infant industries they inaugurated that long series
of protective tariff measures which have continued to
the present day. And whatever may be said of the
utility of these measures at the present time, there can
be no doubt that in the beginning they helped to establish
the manufactures of this country upon a firm basis.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the growth of manufactures, there arose a great
demand for laborers, particularly skilled laborers, who
knew the technique of industry. There was also a great
need for common laborers who would be willing to go
into factories and do the routine work. This supply
was not forthcoming from the native population, who
were, by instinct and training, independent workers,
particularly agriculturists. It was extremely difficult
to persuade any great number of them to forego the
possibility of becoming independent landowners and
cultivators, in order to become hired workers in somebody
else’s factory. The close of the second historical
period, accordingly, is marked by a keen demand for
foreign artisans, and the beginning of a general demand
for immigrant labor, to which Europe was commencing
to respond.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER IV<br> <span class='c017'>1820 TO 1860</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The first act passed by the federal government of the
United States which can in any way be called an immigration
law was primarily designed, not to restrict or
control the admission of immigrants into this country,
but to make some provision for their comfort and safety
while on the voyage—matters which had been shockingly
neglected in the past, with the result of untold
sufferings and horrors. These evils were largely due to
the intolerable overcrowding on shipboard which was
habitual. The act in question aimed to correct these
evils by limiting the number of passengers which might
be carried on any ship to two to every five tons of the
ship’s weight. It furthermore provided that each ship
or vessel leaving an American port was to have on board
for each passenger carried sixty gallons of water, one
gallon of vinegar, one hundred pounds of salted provisions,
and one hundred pounds of wholesome ship bread.
It is very doubtful how much good either of these provisions
ever did to the immigrants. The clause in
regard to overcrowding, based as it was merely on the
ship’s total weight, was wholly inadequate to prevent
extreme overcrowding in such parts of the vessel as
might be assigned to passengers. And as far as the
provision regarding supplies is concerned, it could have
been of no help to the immigrants, as it applied only to
ships leaving an American port. There was one provision
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>of the law, however, which has been of permanent
benefit. This was the stipulation that at the port of
landing a full and complete report or manifest was to
be made by the ship’s officer to the customs authorities,
which was to state the number of passengers carried,
together with the name, sex, age, and occupation of each.
This act was passed on March 2, 1819, and in the year
ending September 30, 1820, the first official statistics of
immigration were collected. From this time to the
present we have a continuous record of arrivals, increasing
in detail with subsequent legal requirements.
Thus the year 1820 stands as a fitting beginning for our
third period.</p>

<p class='c010'>The decade of the twenties was one of great industrial
activity on the part of the American people. Manufactures
increased. The Erie Canal was completed, others
were commenced, and there was a fever of excitement
about them. The first railroads were projected, and
vied with the canals in arousing public enthusiasm.
There was a vast movement of population westward, and
the Ohio River was a busy thoroughfare.</p>

<p class='c010'>All of these enterprises aroused a demand for labor,
which, as we have seen, the native population would
not readily supply. By the middle of the decade the
stream of immigration had begun to respond, so that in
1825 the number of arrivals for the year reached the ten
thousand mark for the first time since statistics had
been collected. By the end of the decade the number had
more than doubled. In the fifteen months ending
December 31, 1832, there were over sixty thousand
arrivals, and in the year 1842, 104,565—the first time
the hundred thousand mark had been reached. Such
an enormous increase in immigration as this could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>fail to have its effect upon the social life of the nation,
and to attract widespread attention. Coupled with the
changing nature of industry, it brought many new
problems before the American people—congestion,
tenement house problems, unemployment, etc. Pauperism,
intemperance, beggary, and prostitution increased.<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c018'><sup>[59]</sup></a>
For many of these evils it began to appear that the immigrants
were partly responsible.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet during the twenties it seems that the immigrants
were, on the whole, in good favor. The great economic
need which they filled outweighed the social burden
which they imposed, but which, as yet, was only vaguely
felt. The hard manual labor on the construction enterprises
of the period was mainly performed by Irish laborers,
who flocked over in great numbers, constituting the
largest single element in the immigration stream, amounting
to probably nearly half of the entire number. It was
believed by many Americans, as well as by foreign
travelers and observers, that the canals and railroads
could never have been built without these sturdy Irishmen.
They were a turbulent and reckless lot, though
perhaps not wholly through their own fault. Their
miserable wages were supplemented by copious supplies
of whisky, with the result that the labor camps were
frequently the scenes of riotous demonstrations which
shocked the sensibilities of the American community.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the end of this decade, however, the evils attendant
upon unregulated immigration were beginning to make
themselves felt among the native population. Chief
among these was the danger from an increase of pauperism.
The frightful shipping conditions, which had
marked previous periods, continued with practically no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>amelioration. The records of the time are full of heartrending
tales of crowded, filthy, unventilated ships, and
penniless, starved, diseased immigrants, often landed
in a state of absolute destitution. The sickening details
of these accounts make the most lurid description of
present-day steerage conditions seem absolutely colorless.
Under such circumstances it was inevitable that a very
large number of these miserable victims should come
immediately, or in a very short time, upon the public
for support. The censuses of the poorhouses showed an
altogether disproportionate number of foreign-born
paupers among the inmates. In Philadelphia, for instance,
it appears that at the beginning of the thirties
the foreign-born paupers made up nearly one third of
the total number, and by 1834 this proportion had increased
to practically one half.<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c018'><sup>[60]</sup></a> Such a state of affairs
naturally aroused the consternation of the natives, and
the feeling was made more intense by the belief that
many of these paupers were taken directly from the almshouses
of foreign countries, and shipped to this country
at public expense. This matter has been the subject of
so much debate that it will be worth while to examine
the truth of these charges in this connection.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Trollope, writing in 1832, said, “I frequently
heard vehement complaints, and constantly met the
same in the newspapers, of a practice stated to be very
generally adopted in Britain of sending out cargoes of
parish paupers to the United States. A Baltimore
paper heads some such remarks with the words ‘INFAMOUS
CONDUCT’ and then tells us of a cargo of
aged paupers just arrived from England, adding ‘John
Bull has squeezed the orange and now insolently casts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>the skin in our faces.’” Mrs. Trollope states that careful
investigation on her part failed to substantiate this
charge.<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c018'><sup>[61]</sup></a> The article referred to is one which appeared
in <cite>Niles’ Register</cite> for July 3, 1830. It gives an account
of the ship <i>Anacreon</i> from Liverpool, which arrived at
Norfolk with 168 passengers, three fourths of whom
were transported English paupers, cast on our shores at
about four pounds ten shillings per head. Many of them
were very aged. The editor’s vehement protest against
such action contrasts sharply with the complacency
with which the same journal had viewed the advent of a
crowd of transported Irish paupers seven years earlier.<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c018'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>An examination of the evidence on the question tends
to support the statement of the Baltimore editor, rather
than the denial of Mrs. Trollope. Other numbers of
<cite>Niles’ Register</cite> contain frequent accounts of such practices.
A letter written from England, dated February
7, 1823, and published in this journal states, “I was
down in the London docks and there were <i>twenty-six
paupers</i> going out in the ship <i>Hudson</i>, to New York,
sent by the parish of Eurbarst, in Sussex, in carriers’
wagons, who paid their passage and gave them money
to start with when they arrived in the U. States.” The
editor states that “this precious cargo has arrived
safely.”<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c018'><sup>[63]</sup></a> Other numbers of the <cite>Register</cite> contain similar
instances, some of them quoted from other papers.<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c018'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>So far the evidence consists mostly of newspaper
tales, and is perhaps open to reasonable doubt, though
where there was so much smoke there must have been
some fire. But more reliable testimony is available.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Charges of the kind in question finally became so prevalent
that the government ordered an investigation, and
on May 15, 1838, Mr. John Forsyth, then Secretary of
State, presented a report on the subject of pauperism
and immigration. This contains a large amount of
testimony, from which it will be sufficient to select a few
typical cases.</p>

<p class='c010'>On June 28, 1831, Mr. R. M. Harrison, United States
consul at Kingston, Jamaica, reported that there was a
local law compelling shipmasters who left that port to
carry away paupers, for which they received $10 each
as remuneration. If they refused to take them, they
were fined $300. As various states had laws forbidding
the landing of paupers, it was customary for shipmasters
to sign the paupers as seamen. The pauper had the
privilege of choosing his own vessel, and most of them
went to the United States. Mr. Van Buren called the
attention of Lord Palmerston, the British Foreign
Secretary, to the affair, and requested a discontinuance
of the practice. Lord Palmerston replied that the
law was to expire December 31, and the governor of
Jamaica had been instructed to withhold his assent to
any similar law.<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c018'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Albert Davy, United States consul at Kingston-upon-Hull,
Leeds, England, reported that while no reliable
lists were kept at customhouses, distinguishing
paupers from others, it was generally known that paupers
emigrated, and several shipmasters admitted that passage
was paid by parish overseers. If a pauper was an
exceptionally hard case, he could demand considerable
sums of money in addition to his passage, refusing to go
unless they were paid.<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c018'><sup>[66]</sup></a> Mr. F. List on March 8, 1837,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>reported from Leipsic that not only paupers, but criminals,
were transported from the interior to seaports, to
be embarked for the United States. A certain Mr.
de Stein contracts with the governments to transport
paupers for $75 per head, and several of the governments
have accepted his proposition. There is a plan
to empty the jails and workhouses in this way. It is a
common practice in Germany to get rid of paupers and
vicious characters by collecting money to send them to
the United States.<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c018'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>That it was customary to transport criminals as well as
paupers is verified by the fact that during 1837 two lots
of convicts arrived in Baltimore: one a party of fourteen
convicts on a ship from Bremen, who had been embarked
in irons, which had not been stricken off until near the
fort; the other a shipload of 200 to 250 Hessian convicts,
whose manacles and fetters remained upon their hands
and feet until within the day of their arrival.<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c018'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>A memorial of the corporation of the city of New York,
January 25, 1847, states that within the last year the ships
<i>Sardinia</i> and <i>Atlas</i> from Liverpool arrived in New York,
one with 294 and the other with 314 steerage passengers,
all paupers, sent by the parish of Grosszimmern, Hesse
Darmstadt, to which they belonged and by which their
expenses were paid. Two hundred and thirty-four of
these immigrants, 117 from each ship, eventually found
their way into the New York almshouse.<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c018'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>On January 19, 1839, <cite>Niles’ Register</cite> reported a crowd
of paupers which had arrived in New York from England.
Their passage had been paid by the overseers of the poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>at Edinburgh, and the majority of them were still wearing
the uniform of the poorhouse. This naturally
aroused objections, and the consignees of the vessel
finally agreed to take them back to Europe, and to repay
the city all expense that it had incurred on their account.
The United States consul at Basle, Switzerland,
reported in 1846 that it was the practice in that country
for congregations or town authorities to send paupers to
America.<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c018'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Instances of this sort might be multiplied, but these
will suffice to prove that the practice of transporting
paupers was a common one during the period we are considering.
Just when it was finally stopped it is impossible
to say.<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c018'><sup>[71]</sup></a> It certainly played a large part in creating
the feeling of hostility to immigrants which manifested
itself strongly during the decade of the thirties.</p>

<p class='c010'>That the situation was partially, at least, comprehended
also in England is evidenced by a burlesque
poem entitled “Immiscible Immigration,” written in
that country, which commences with the following words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>While the dangers from pauperism and criminality were
probably the leading causes for opposition to immigration,
at this time, other broader and deeper objections
were beginning to be felt and to be expressed in current
writings. In the <cite>North American Review</cite> for April, 1835
(p. 457), there is a very sane, calm and convincing article
by Mr. A. H. Everett, in which the disadvantages of immigration
are set forth. Many of the stock arguments
of to-day are well set forth here, among them, of course,
the dangers from pauperism and crime, but also the
dangers of a heterogeneous population, of poor assimilation,
congestion in cities, misuse of political power, and
the growth of foreign colonies. The author questions
whether the immigrants are really filling the demand
for labor, and urges the necessity of furnishing the immigrants
with information about different sections of
the country, and advising them about their destination.
He also feels the need of much greater discrimination
in the admission of aliens.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the same magazine, in the issue for January, 1841,
there is an article entitled “The Irish in America,” in
which the author names as one of the great grievances
against the immigrants that they do more work for less
money than the native workingmen, and live on a lower
standard, thereby decreasing wages. This is one of the
earliest expressions which we find of this objection, and
shows that by this time the country had passed beyond
the primitive stage where there was room enough for
everybody, and no fear of economic competition. It
is the foreshadowing of modern conditions and modern
thought.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was still another ground for opposition to the
immigrants which very possibly at the end of the thirties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>eclipsed all the others in positive influence.<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c018'><sup>[73]</sup></a> This was
the hatred and fear of the Roman Catholic religion, to
which the great majority of the Irish adhered. The
Protestant bias which had strongly characterized the
early settlers still persisted among the great body of the
American people. This motive was the leading one
which led to the formation of the first political party
which was openly based on opposition to immigration.
This was the Native American party which came into
prominence as a political movement about 1835, in which
year there was a Nativist candidate for Congress in
New York City. In the following year the party
nominated a candidate for mayor of New York. Nativist
societies were formed in Germantown, Pa., and in Washington,
D.C., in 1837, and two years later the party was
organized in Louisiana, where a state convention was
held in 1841. The adherents of this movement did not
confine themselves to peaceful and orderly methods, but
resorted to anti-Catholic riots in 1844. Two Catholic
churches were destroyed in Philadelphia, and a convent
in Boston.<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c018'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In 1845 the Nativist movement claimed 48,000 members
in New York, 42,000 in Pennsylvania, 14,000 in
Massachusetts, and 6000 in other states. In Congress
it had six representatives from New York and two from
Pennsylvania. Its first national convention was held
in Philadelphia in 1845.<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c018'><sup>[75]</sup></a> A national platform was
adopted, the chief demands being the repeal of the
naturalization laws, and the appointment of native
Americans only to office. They succeeded in securing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>a certain amount of congressional investigation in 1838,
and a bill was presented by a committee appointed for
the purpose, which proposed to fine shipmasters who
tried to bring into the United States aliens who were
idiots, lunatics, maniacs, or afflicted with any incurable
disease, in the sum of $1000, and to require them to forfeit
a like sum for every alien brought in who had not
the ability to maintain himself. “Congress did not
even consider this bill, and during the next ten years
little attempt was made to secure legislation against
the foreigner,”<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c018'><sup>[76]</sup></a> though many petitions to extend the
period of residence for naturalization were received. The
ever increasing opposition to unregulated immigration
had not yet become sufficiently widespread to accomplish
any positive measures.</p>

<p class='c010'>During this period the immigrants were almost wholly
from the United Kingdom and Germany, with the Irish in
the lead, as we have seen. There were also considerable
numbers of French, who outnumbered the Germans in
some years in the early part of the period, and small
contingents from various other nations, particularly the
Scandinavian countries. It was natural that the ties of
relationship, language, etc., should put the United Kingdom
at the head at this time, and conditions in Ireland
were such as to make emigration a very welcome means
of relief. The Irish tended to linger in the cities, where
they went into domestic and personal service, or to go
out into the construction camps. The Germans and
Scandinavians, on the other hand, tended to move westward
into the interior, and colonies of these races were
becoming numerous in several of the middle western
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>states. The Germans of this period were mostly farmers
from the thinly settled agricultural sections of the old
country, and the great attraction which the United States
had for them was the ease with which good farm lands
might be secured in this country.<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c018'><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Most of the agitation about immigration, as has been
intimated, centered round the Irish, but there was also
some feeling against the Germans. This was augmented
by the decided clannishness of these people. There
were many German societies and newspapers, and a
strong and ill-disguised movement to form an independent
German state in Texas, or elsewhere on the continent,
which was not calculated to endear them to the
native American.</p>

<p class='c010'>Up to the year 1842 the total immigration did not
reach one hundred thousand annually, and for the next
three years it fell below that figure again.<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c018'><sup>[78]</sup></a> During the
last half of this decade, however, certain events occurred
in Europe which vastly increased the immigration current,
and brought the matter more forcibly to the notice
of the American people than ever before. These were
the potato famine in Ireland, and the political upheavals
of 1848 in various nations of Europe, particularly in
Germany. The result of the latter occurrences was to
leave a large number of middle class liberalists in Germany
in a very undesirable situation, in spite of the
partial success of the revolution. The way out, for
them, was emigration. This is one of the best examples
in history of the political cause of emigration, though
even here economic motives were also concerned. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>tremendous emigration followed, reaching its climax
in 1854, when 215,009 immigrants from Germany reached
this country. These were mainly persons of good
character and independent spirit, as might be expected
from the causes of their departure. Considerable
numbers of Bohemians also emigrated at this period,
similar in character to the Germans, and actuated by
similar motives and conditions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Conditions in Ireland at about the same time resulted
in an emigration rivaling that from Germany in numbers,
but by no means so desirable from the point of
view of the United States. It was almost exclusively
an economic movement. The introduction of the potato
into Ireland by Raleigh in 1610 had seemed at first a
blessing to the country. It furnished an easy and abundant
food supply, and its cultivation spread rapidly.
Population increased correspondingly, growing from
2,845,932 in 1785 to 5,356,594 in 1803 and 8,295,061 in
1845. By the latter year most of the population were
dependent for their subsistence upon the potato. This
was a precarious situation, for the potato furnishes the
largest amount of food in proportion to the land used
of almost any crop which is grown in temperate regions.
In other words, the Irish were living on a very low standard
as far as food was concerned, with no margin to fall
back on in case of calamity. A people subsisting upon
grains and meat may, in time of distress, resort to cheaper
and more easily secured food materials temporarily.
But a land which is densely populated by people living
on the cheapest possible food has no resources when
any misfortune attacks their staple supply. Ireland
was in this situation in the middle forties, and the misfortune
came in the shape of the potato murrain, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>attacked the plants in 1845 and caused an almost complete
failure of the crop for that year.</p>

<p class='c010'>Extreme hardship, privation, and distress followed.
From 200,000 to 300,000 died of starvation or of fever
caused by insufficient food. All who could sought relief
in flight. Benevolent agencies in England and Ireland
came to their assistance, and enormous numbers of Irish,
in one way or another, found the means for emigration,
and embarked for Canada or the United States. Added
to the great numbers of Germans who were coming at
the same time, they caused the first great wave in the
immigration current, reaching a maximum of 427,833
in the year 1854, a number which was not exceeded until
1873. After 1854 the immigration current dwindled
rapidly, until in 1862 it amounted to only 72,183.</p>

<p class='c010'>During this entire period, up to the time of the great
influx from Germany and Ireland, immigration had
been practically unregulated so far as the United States
government was concerned, the only federal law bearing
on the subject being the ineffective act of 1819. Many
of the individual states, however, had attempted to cope
with the evils of the situation by restrictive or protective
measures. New York took the lead in this matter. In
this state there were two sets of laws bearing on the
question. The first of these had to do with the support
of the marine hospital. As early as 1820 New York had
passed a law (April 14, 1820, Chapter 229) levying a
tax of $1.50 each for the captain and cabin passengers,
and $1 each for steerage passengers, mates, sailors, and
mariners, payable by the master of every vessel from a
foreign port arriving at a New York port. The proceeds
were to be used for the benefit of the marine hospital.
This law was continued and reënacted, with slight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>changes in the amount of the tax, at frequent intervals
during the next twenty-five years.<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c018'><sup>[79]</sup></a> It was a real head
tax, and may have had a slight restrictive influence
upon immigration.</p>

<p class='c010'>Much more important than this set of laws, however,
was another group, specifically concerned with the immigration
situation. The first<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c018'><sup>[80]</sup></a> of these was the law of
February 11, 1824, which required the master of every
ship coming from any foreign country, or from any other
state than New York, to report to the mayor in writing,
within twenty-four hours after landing, the name, place
of birth, last legal settlement, age, and occupation of all
passengers, under a penalty of $75 for each person not
reported, or reported falsely. The mayor might require
a bond, not exceeding $300, for each passenger
not a citizen of the United States, to indemnify the
authorities of New York against any expense incurred
in connection with such passengers, or their children
born after landing, for the space of two years. Whenever
any passenger, being a citizen of the United States,
was deemed likely to become a public charge to the city,
the master of the ship should at once remove him at his
(the master’s) expense to his place of last settlement,
or else defray all expenses incurred by the city. Non-citizens
entering the city with the intention of residing
there must within twenty-four hours report themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>to the mayor, giving their name, birthplace, etc., the
time and place of landing, the name of the ship and commander,
under penalty of $300.</p>

<p class='c010'>This law remained in force for twenty-three years.
On May 5, 1847, a more inclusive immigration law was
passed of which the most important provisions were as
follows:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 1.</span> The shipmaster shall report the name,
place of birth, last legal residence, age, and occupation
of every person or passenger arriving in the ship, not
being a citizen of the United States. The report shall
further specify whether any of the passengers reported
are lunatic, idiot, deaf and dumb, blind or infirm, and
if so, whether they are accompanied by relatives likely
to be able to support them. A report is to be made of
those who have died on the voyage. Penalty for violation,
$75.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 2.</span> For each person reported, the sum of one
dollar is to be paid by the master within three days after
arrival.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 3.</span> The commissioners of emigration shall
go on board of arriving vessels and examine their passengers.
If any of the defective classes mentioned in
Section 1 are found, not members of emigrating families,
and likely to become a public charge, a bond of $300 for
five years shall be required, in place of the commutation
fee of one dollar.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 4.</span> Commissioners of emigration are appointed,
to have charge of the business of immigration.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 14.</span> The commissioners of emigration are
made recipients and custodians of the marine hospital
funds.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 16.</span> The commissioners are given power to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>erect buildings for the handling of the immigration
business.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 18.</span> The act of February 11, 1824, is repealed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under this law a special body of officials took charge
of the handling of immigrants for New York State, and
a more systematic and effective method was introduced.</p>

<p class='c010'>The foregoing law and the corresponding law of
Massachusetts were both declared unconstitutional by
the Supreme Court of the United States in January,
1849,<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c018'><sup>[81]</sup></a> on the ground that the power to levy a head tax
was conferred on Congress by Article 1, Section 8, of
the Constitution, being included in the “power to regulate
commerce with foreign nations.”<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c018'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>New York, however, at once (April 11, 1849) passed
another law, even more stringent in its requirements
than the foregoing one, but designed to avoid the constitutional
difficulties. A bond of $300 was required
for <i>all</i> alien passengers, which might be commuted for
the sum of $1.50. If any alien passengers are “lunatic,
idiot, deaf, dumb, blind, or infirm persons not members of
emigrating families,” or likely to become a public charge,
or have been paupers in any other country, they are to
be bonded in the sum of $500 for ten years, in addition
to the commutation money. On such bonds the authorities
were empowered to collect enough money to defray
the expenses incurred in connection with the immigrants,
not exceeding the amount of the bond.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the act of July 11, 1851, the defective classes were
added to by the inclusion of persons maimed, or above
the age of sixty years, or under thirteen, widows having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>families, or women without husbands having families, or
any person unable to take care of himself or herself without
becoming a public charge. The bond of $500 for
undesirables was retained, but the time limit was reduced
to five years.</p>

<p class='c010'>Practically all of the other states which received trans-Atlantic
vessels had laws similar to the bonding law of
New York, for their protection against pauper immigration.
The Massachusetts law was much more severe
than that of New York, and was believed to keep many
immigrants away from that state. The Massachusetts
law passed April 20, 1837, required shipmasters to deposit
a bond of $1000 for ten years for each lunatic,
idiot, maimed, aged, or infirm immigrant brought in,
and for those incompetent to maintain themselves, or who
have been paupers in any other country. For each other
alien passenger the shipmaster was to pay the sum of $2.</p>

<p class='c010'>In all of this legislation the states found themselves in
the dilemma of wishing to frame laws which would keep
out undesirable immigrants, and yet would not operate
to discourage aliens of good quality. The desire for an
increase of population by immigration, which was shared
by practically all the states, and the fear of diverting the
current from one state to another, led to a greater laxity
in the attitude of each state than would probably have
existed if each could have acted altogether independently.
This made the state regulation of immigration
most unsatisfactory.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was inevitable, considering the immensity and
suddenness of the immigration movement at this time,
and the lack of experience in dealing with such a problem
on the part of the American people, that grievous
evils should arise. The immigrants, particularly the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Irish, were a destitute and helpless lot, and fell an easy
prey to the machinations of the host of exploiters which
at once sprang up to take advantage of the newly presented
opportunities. Countless devices were put in
practice for separating the immigrant from whatever
valuable goods he brought with him. New York, in
particular, as the center of the traffic, swarmed with a
host of runners, agents, and solicitors of every kind, who
fleeced the newcomers without remorse or pity. These
runners were themselves mostly earlier immigrants,
who could more readily gain the confidence of the aliens.
The handling and inspection of these aliens by the officials
was also a weighty problem. It was in the hope of
checking the operations of the runners, as well as to provide
suitable arrangements for the examination of arriving
immigrants, that the Board of Commissioners of
Emigration of New York State was created by the act
of 1847. This timely action undoubtedly prevented the
various evils connected with this immense movement
from going to the extremes that they otherwise would
have reached, and that they did reach in certain respects
in Canada.<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c018'><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>In 1855 commissioners leased an old fort at the
foot of Manhattan Island, known as Castle Garden, to
serve as an immigrant station. This did duty for many
years and was considered one of the most interesting
spots in the metropolis. It also proved of great service
in restraining the operations of the immigrant runners.<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c018'><sup>[84]</sup></a>
It goes without saying that it was by no means successful
in putting a permanent stop to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The bonding provision of the New York State law had
one remarkable and unfortunate result. A class of
brokers sprang up who took the responsibility of bonding
the immigrants from the shipowners. It was obviously
to their advantage to keep as many of the immigrants
as possible from coming upon the public for
support. To accomplish this, they established private
hospitals and poorhouses on the outskirts of New York
and Brooklyn, in which dependent aliens were placed.
The effort to maintain them here at the least possible
expense resulted in extreme neglect. A committee of
the Board of Aldermen of New York City was appointed
to look into this matter, in the year 1846. They
found conditions which were almost unbelievable. In
one apartment, fifty feet square, they discovered one
hundred sick and dying immigrants lying on straw.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>In their midst were the bodies of two others who had died
four or five days earlier, and had been left there. The
worst kind of food was specially purchased for the consumption
of these victims. The conditions unearthed
by this investigation contributed to the sentiment which
brought about the passage of the law of 1847.<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c018'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The chaotic state of the immigration situation, the
inadequacy of state control, and the increasing obviousness
of the resulting evils led to a growing demand for
federal action on the matter. This feeling found expression
in numerous petitions and memorials presented
to Congress by state legislatures, city councils, and
private citizens. These began to appear about 1835,
with the rise of the Native American party. With the
increased immigration of the latter forties, the demand
became more insistent. The immediate and crying evil,
which attracted the greatest attention, lay in the unspeakable
shipping conditions which still existed.<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c018'><sup>[86]</sup></a> In
1847 Mr. Rathbun stated on the floor of Congress that
emigrants from abroad were frequently landed in the
port of New York in such a diseased condition, due to
overcrowding on the ships which brought them, that
they were unable to walk. They were carried in carts
direct to the almshouse, and sometimes died on the way.<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c018'><sup>[87]</sup></a>
In the same year, out of ninety thousand immigrants
who embarked for Canada in British vessels, fifteen
thousand died on the way. This exceeded even the
suffering in vessels bound for the United States.<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c018'><sup>[88]</sup></a> On
the whole, conditions seem to have been the best on the
German and American vessels.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>In response to these conditions, and to the growing
demand for a remedy, Congress on February 22, 1847,
passed a law, superseding that of 1819, and designed to
remedy the evils of overcrowding. The provisions
about victualing the ships remained the same as before,
but the new law provided for a certain allotment of
superficial, or square feet of, deck space per passenger,
and also limited the number of passengers in proportion
to the tonnage of the ship. This law was not satisfactory,
however, and was very soon superseded by the
act of May 17, 1848, which remained in force until
1855. In 1849 the British government passed a law,
designed to secure the same ends as the American laws.
It was under the operation of these three laws that the
great flood of Irish immigration crossed the Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c010'>The American statutes required that the deck space,
unoccupied by stores or goods, except passengers’ baggage,
should average fourteen square feet for each passenger,
man, woman, or child, excepting infants not one
year old. If the space between decks was less than six
feet, there must be sixteen square feet per passenger,
and if less than five feet, twenty-two square feet (a
significant commentary on the ship construction of the
day). There were to be not more than two tiers of
berths on any deck, and the berths were to be not less
than six feet by one and one half feet in dimensions.
The British statute set a limit of one passenger (exclusive
of cabin) for every two tons registered tonnage, two children
under fourteen years of age being counted as one,
and children under one year not being counted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Up to this time it had been customary on immigrant
ships to require passengers to provide their own stores,
but on account of the lack of intelligence and foresight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>on the part of the passengers, both the American and
British statutes required ships to carry a certain amount
and kind of provisions for each passenger, as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>The passengers were still required to do their own cooking,
and the American act provided for the building of
cooking ranges for the use of steerage passengers, in proportion
to the number carried.</p>

<p class='c010'>Most of the Irish passengers were collected at Liverpool,
though by 1847 there were also many direct sailings
from Ireland. They were mainly booked through
passenger brokers, who often imposed on them, but apparently
not so much as might have been expected.
There was a medical inspection at Liverpool, and emigrants
were required to be certified against contagious
diseases. The average length of the passage from Liverpool
to New York in 1849 was about thirty-five days,
and from London about forty-three and one half days.
But voyages were often much prolonged. One ship, the
<i>Speed</i> (!), in 1848 had a passage of twelve weeks,
with great ensuing hardship. The British act provided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>that if ships had to turn back, the passengers must be
transshipped to another vessel, and in the meantime
maintained at the master’s expense. This often resulted
in hardship, instead of benefit, as ships sometimes
kept on the voyage when they were not fitted to
sail. In 1849 and 1850 some ships turned back after
having been out seventy days. The British government
tried to induce steamers to take steerage passengers
by allowing them to provide provisions for only
forty days, while sailing vessels had to provide for
seventy. Very few immigrants, nevertheless, were
carried on steam vessels during these years. The deaths
on these voyages were mainly due to ship fever, a severe
form of Irish typhus.<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c018'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Though the German immigrants at this time were
at least as numerous as the Irish, they attracted much
less attention. This was partly because they were less
poverty-stricken, and partly because they mostly moved
on to the west, and did not collect in the cities of the
Atlantic seaboard. The Irish, in consequence of their
native character, the circumstances which led to their
coming, and the conditions of the voyage, were in a
particularly helpless state when they arrived. They
were the most prominent victims of the runners, and
made the largest showing in the hospitals and almshouses.
In spite of the good accomplished by the
state and federal statutes, an extreme amount of destitution
and suffering persisted. The burden of foreign
pauperism, in particular, increased tremendously. In
1850 more than half the paupers wholly or partially
supported in the United States were of foreign birth.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>In the North Atlantic coastal states the proportion was
much larger.<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c018'><sup>[90]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>These considerations, added to the preponderance of
Roman Catholics among the Irish immigrants, led to a
renewal of the anti-immigration agitation, which had
been so vigorous ten years earlier. This time the movement
took the form of a secret organization, started
probably in New York City in 1850. This society grew
rapidly. Its meetings were held in secret, and the purpose
and even the name of the organization were so
much of a mystery at first that the rank and file of the
members, either from necessity or from choice, were in
the habit of answering all questions regarding it by saying,
“I don’t know.” Hence it came to be known as the
“Know Nothing” party, and as such has come down to
history.<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c018'><sup>[91]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The organization did not long maintain its ultra-secret
character. This had mostly disappeared by 1854,
and the society openly indorsed candidates, and put
forward candidates of its own. It is recorded that in
1855 the governors and legislatures in New Hampshire,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York,
California, and Kentucky were Know Nothings, and
that they had secured many offices in other states. By
1855 they began to mature plans for the presidential
election. They adopted a platform calling for a change
in the existing naturalization laws, for the repeal of the
state laws allowing unnaturalized foreigners to vote, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>the repeal by Congress of all acts making land grants
to unnaturalized foreigners and allowing them to vote
in the territories. In 1856 a national convention was
held, and Millard Fillmore was nominated for president.
The principles of the platform adopted were that Americans
must rule America, that native-born citizens should
be selected for all state, federal, and municipal government
employment in preference to all others, that the
naturalization law should be changed so as to require
twenty-one years’ residence, and that a law should be
passed excluding from the United States all paupers or
persons convicted of crime. This party had its greatest
strength in the thirty-fourth Congress, 1854–1856, and in
the discussions of the period many severe charges were
made against the immigrants.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Know Nothings were in the minority and
consequently had little real influence on legislation.
The immigration laws proposed by them were, as a rule,
confined to the exclusion of foreign paupers and criminals,
and none of these was passed.<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c018'><sup>[92]</sup></a> The diversion of
public interest from immigration affairs to the great
questions of slavery, and the events preliminary to the
Civil War, coupled with the decline in the volume of
immigration after 1854, led to the natural decline and
final break-up of the Know Nothing party.</p>

<p class='c010'>The agitation of the period, however, particularly in
regard to steerage conditions, had its effect on Congress,
and in 1853 a select committee of the Senate was appointed
to investigate the conditions of steerage immigration
and, in particular, “the causes and the extent of
the sickness and mortality prevailing on board the
emigrant ships on the voyage to this country,” and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>determine what legislation, if any, was necessary to
secure better conditions. This committee reported on
August 2, 1854, and on March 3, 1855, a bill was passed
which, with slight modifications, governed the carriage
of immigrants up to 1882. The design of this act was to
improve steerage conditions, and “theoretically the law
of 1855 provided for an increased air space, better ventilation,
and improved accommodations in the way of
berths, cooking facilities, the serving of food, free open
deck space, and so forth. Although the evil of overcrowding,
which had been attended with such disastrous
results in former years, appears to have been especially
aimed at by the makers of the law, the wording of the
act was, unfortunately, such that the provisions relating
to the number of passengers to be carried were inoperative,
and there was practically no legal restraint in this
regard, as far as the United States law was concerned,
between 1855 and 1882.”<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c018'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Practically the only amendment to the steerage law
from 1855 to 1882 was an act of 1860, designed to secure
much-needed protection for female passengers from immoral
conduct on the part of members of the crew. A
fine of $1000 was imposed on any person employed on
any ship of the United States who was found guilty of
such conduct, and members of the crew were forbidden
to visit parts of the ship assigned to immigrants, except
under the direction or with the permission of the commanding
officer.</p>

<p class='c010'>It will be observed that, while the various state laws
had a slightly restrictive effect, all of the federal acts of
this period, designed as they were to secure better accommodations
on the voyage, served as an encouragement,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>rather than a deterrent, to immigration. And,
on the whole, in spite of the violent anti-immigrant
agitation of the nativistic and Know Nothing movements
and the dread of foreign paupers and criminals,
the preponderance of public opinion in the United States
was probably favorable to the immigrant as such. It
must be remembered that during this entire period the
United States was still distinctly a new country. There
was an abundance of unoccupied land which might be
secured on easy terms. There was a large westward
movement of population from the Atlantic seaboard,
and the growing manufactures and internal improvements
created a large demand for labor. It was, as a
whole, a decidedly thinly settled country. All of these
things combined to give the immigrant every advantage
in the mind of the native citizen.</p>

<p class='c010'>Reviewing the third period, we see that it was a period
of rapidly increasing immigration, responding to the
expanding industry and exceptionally favorable agricultural
situation in this country. The movement culminated
in the enormous immigration of the late forties
and early fifties. These were mainly Germans, who
left their home primarily for political reasons, and took
up farm lands in the west, and Irish, who emigrated because
of economic disaster, and tended to linger in the
eastern cities, or to go out into the construction camps.
Both of these races were closely allied to the American
people, and easily assimilated. At the beginning of the
period, the attitude of the American people was almost
wholly one of welcome, but with the increase of the current,
bringing as it did enormous numbers of destitute
and helpless aliens, there arose a distinct feeling of opposition
to unregulated immigration, based primarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>upon the dislike of foreign paupers and criminals, and
aided by the undeniable practice of foreign countries of
emptying their poorhouses, and even their jails, upon our
shores. This feeling later came to be intensified by a
strong antipathy to Roman Catholics and the restriction
of immigration was made a party policy. Nevertheless,
the opposition to immigration did not, during this period,
attain sufficient strength to secure any important legislation.
Many of the states had laws designed to indemnify
the communities against expense on account
of foreign paupers, which may have had a slight restrictive
effect. But such federal legislation as there was,
was directed to the improvement of the conditions of
the voyage, and hence had an encouraging rather than
a restrictive tendency. With the approach of the Civil
War immigration fell off, and public attention was
diverted to other matters.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER V<br> <span class='c017'>1860 TO 1882</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The disturbances connected with the Civil War, following
the industrial depression of 1857, naturally produced
a diminution in the immigration current, which
in the year 1862 fell to 72,183, the lowest point it had
reached for more than twenty years, and one which has
never been reached since. This condition, which tended
to allay the excessive fear of immigration which had
marked the previous decade, was augmented by certain
other factors. Foremost among these was the enormous
internal migration of people from the east to the middle
and farther west, encouraged by the liberal homestead
act of 1862. This movement, in connection with the
loss of life occasioned by the war, seemed to leave great
gaps in the population of the eastern states, and put the
foreigners who came to fill them in much better favor.
Many of the immigrants themselves also moved on to
the west and took up new land, where they crowded
nobody and rendered a real service in the building up of
the country.</p>

<p class='c010'>These facts explain what would otherwise seem an
extraordinary circumstance—namely, that the first
federal law passed with the avowed intent of regulating
the volume of immigration was an act to encourage
immigration. This was the act of July 4, 1864, which
provided for the appointment by the President of a
Commissioner of Immigration, to be under the direction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>of the Department of State, and further provided that
all contracts made in foreign countries by immigrants
pledging the wages of their labor for a term not exceeding
twelve months should be valid. An immigration
office was to be established in New York City, in charge
of a Superintendent of Immigration, to look after the
transporting of immigrants to their final destination,
and protecting them from imposition and fraud. Several
companies, in pursuance of this act, were formed for the
purpose of dealing in contract labor. But protests
against the character of immigrants continued strong,
and the law was repealed in 1868. The feeling of opposition
to contract labor in general was also beginning to
assert itself at this time, and continued to grow, so that
the next federal legislation touching on contract labor
was of a wholly different character.</p>

<p class='c010'>This period witnessed another important change in
the immigration situation—the transition from the
sailing vessel to the steamship as the prevailing type of
immigrant carrier. “Writers on the history of sail and
steam navigation agree that steamships played no part
prior to 1850 in the transportation of other than cabin
passengers. In that year the Inman Line of steamships,
then recently established, began to compete with sailing
vessels by providing third class, or steerage, accommodation....
Once established in the emigrant carrying
trade, steamships quickly monopolized the greater part
of the business.”<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c018'><sup>[94]</sup></a> In 1856, of the passengers landed at
Castle Garden, New York, 96.4 per cent were carried
on sailing vessels, and 3.6 per cent on steamships. In
1873 the proportions were almost exactly reversed—3.2
per cent on sailing vessels, and 96.8 per cent on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>steamships. The turn of the balance came between
the years 1864 and 1865; in the first of these years the
sailing vessels carried 55.7 per cent of the passengers,
and in the second, 41.7 per cent. “No consistent data
are available to show the relative number of passengers
carried on sailing vessels and steamships after 1873, but
it was not long until steamships had practically a complete
monopoly of the business.”<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c018'><sup>[95]</sup></a> This change did
more to alleviate the conditions of the steerage than
anything which had transpired previously.</p>

<p class='c010'>The change from sail to steam was accompanied by
the loss of the primary position in the immigrant-carrying
field by the United States. In the rivalry for the steamship
business she was quickly outstripped by England.
Chance played a part in this outcome through the loss of
two of the largest ships of the Collins Line, but the conscious
policy of the United States contributed to the
result. The available capital of the country was diverted
to manufactures and railroad building by the
artificial stimulus given to these industries—by the
tariff on the one hand, and the land grants on the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the return of prosperity after the war, the
volume of immigration began to increase again, and in
1873 culminated in the record figure of 459,803. The
industrial depression of that year cut down the influx,
and the next record was not reached until 1882, the year
that inaugurates the modern period. During the entire
period under discussion the two main elements in the
immigration stream were the Irish and the Germans.
The climax of the immigration from the United Kingdom
(mostly Irish) had been reached in 1851, with a total of
272,240, a figure which has never been equaled since.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>The immigration from Germany in the year 1854 had
reached 215,009, a number which has been exceeded
only once since then (in 1882). In 1854, 87.7 per cent
of the entire immigration came from these two sources.
In 1873, 68.8 per cent still showed the same origin.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the closing years of this period people of
Scandinavian origin occupied a noteworthy place in the
immigration field. Small parties of Norwegians, Danes,
and Swedes had appeared early in the nineteenth century,
and had been followed by others from time to time.
These early immigrants had formed settlements, for the
most part agricultural, in various parts of the country,
particularly in the middle west and northwest. But
they were an inconsiderable part of the total immigration
until after the Civil War. In 1873 they amounted
to 7.7 per cent of the total immigration, and in 1882 to
13.4 per cent. The underlying causes which predisposed
the natives of the Scandinavian countries to emigration
were found in the rugged and inhospitable character of
the soil, and the severe and uncertain climate. Only
a small part of the total land area was available for cultivation,
and there was little room for an expanding
population. Thus the fundamental causes of emigration
were economic. Religious differences and the
demands of military service played minor parts. Political
oppression entered in somewhat in the case of the
Danes.</p>

<p class='c010'>The more immediate causes are found in a period of
financial depression between 1866 and 1870, the Dano-Prussian
War of 1864, the activities of steamship agents,
and more particularly the letters and visits from the
earlier emigrants and adventurers, who told in person of
the advantages and opportunities of life in America.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>These, as always, had a profound effect in stirring up
enthusiasm for emigration.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Scandinavian emigrants came mainly from rural
regions and rural occupations, and naturally tended to
follow out the same bent in their new home, resembling
in this respect their kinsmen, the Germans. Like
them, too, they were easily assimilated, and aroused little
opposition on the part of the Americans.<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c018'><sup>[96]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>It was in connection with one of these leading groups
of immigrants—the Irish—that there developed one of
the most unfortunate, and at the same time interesting,
series of events that have occurred in connection with
the immigrant situation during our entire history—one
that had much to do with arousing antipathy
toward foreigners, and was among the influences that
led to the introduction of new races from southeastern
Europe.<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c018'><sup>[97]</sup></a> This was the Molly Maguire disturbance in the
anthracite region of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the anthracite coal districts of Pennsylvania
were opened up, early in the second quarter of the nineteenth
century, the social conditions in the new settlements
resembled those of a gold mining region, in the
prevalence of lawlessness, excitability, and turbulence.
The country was still rough and thinly settled, and between
the mining settlements were wide stretches of
virgin wilds which furnished ideal hiding places for criminals
and refugees. As the knowledge of mining was
largely confined to foreigners, they came to occupy a
large place in the colliery towns, and prominent among
them were the Irish. As the numbers of Irish increased,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Irish customs and ideas came to practically dominate
many places. Other foreign races represented were the
Germans, English, Welsh, Scotch, and Poles. The immigrants
from Ireland during the forties and fifties were
not all worthy representatives of the race, as many of the
more turbulent characters were practically compelled by
the landlords to join the general exodus.</p>

<p class='c010'>As early as 1854 there appeared among the Irish miners
an organization known as the Molly Maguires—a
name long known in Ireland, though there was no organic
connection between the societies in the old and
new world. Its members were all Irish and all professed
adherents to the Roman Catholic Church, though both the
church and the better elements of the race absolutely
repudiated them and their acts. Also, practically all
the Molly Maguires were members of the Ancient Order
of Hibernians, and were able so to control this organization,
legally chartered for beneficial purposes, as to use
it as a cloak for their nefarious enterprises.</p>

<p class='c010'>The power of the Molly Maguires was used primarily
to further the ends of its members in their relations with
the colliery owners and bosses; whenever a dispute
arose between an employee and a boss, the latter would
be served with a notice, frequently decorated with rude
pictures of coffins, death’s heads, and the like, warning
him to desist in his course or to leave the region. If
he failed to obey, he was almost sure soon after to be
waylaid and cruelly beaten, as well as to suffer social
ostracism. The perpetrators of the deed of violence
always escaped, and thus confidence and a sense of
power grew in the organization.</p>

<p class='c010'>Soon after the breaking out of the Civil War, conditions
in the anthracite region became such as to improve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the situation of the miners and add to the power of
the Molly Maguires. They became more and more insolent
in their demands, and ambitious in their purposes.
They tried to gain control of the Miners’ Union, and
also, with a measure of success, sought to dominate local
politics, with their eye primarily upon the township
funds. They succeeded in making the lives of the small
mine owners such a burden that they were glad to sell
out to the large combinations; thus the growth of large
units and monopolies was fostered, as they alone could
deal with the Molly Maguires on anything like terms of
equality. In the meantime, the methods of the society
increased in harshness and barbarity. Arson and murder
took the place of beating. There arose a rivalry among
the Mollies as to who should gain the greatest reputation
for deeds of reckless savagery. Murder after murder
was committed, without a conviction. The victims
were often men of the highest repute and usefulness in
their respective communities. The motives for the outrages
increased in variety, including almost any injury,
real or fancied, or any personal grudge on the part of a
member of the society, though rarely were they committed
for robbery. A general reign of terror settled
down over the region, and vigilance committees were
being formed for purposes of reprisal.</p>

<p class='c010'>At this juncture, in 1873, Mr. Franklin B. Gowen,
president of the Philadelphia and Reading Coal and
Iron Company, and a man of remarkable character,
enlisted the services of the Pinkerton Detective Agency
in the effort to stamp out the organization. A young
Irish detective, James McParlan, was chosen for the
dangerous and difficult work. He was instructed to go
to the anthracite region, join the Molly Maguires, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>get as high in their counsels as possible, in order that he
might reveal their secrets to the authorities, thereby
preventing outrages when possible and securing convictions
where he could not prevent. He was successful
in both efforts. After many months of work and peril
he finally succeeded in securing sufficient evidence to accomplish
the conviction of a large number of the members
of the society, breaking down completely their customary
defense of an alibi. In all, nineteen Molly Maguires
were hanged, and a larger number imprisoned, and the
power of the organization was completely shattered.</p>

<p class='c010'>This series of events is a remarkable illustration of the
way in which customs, and habits of thought, and standards
of conduct, which have grown up by a natural
process, and are comprehensible if not excusable in one
land, may develop most alarming and disgraceful features
when transplanted to a new environment. The essential
strength of the Molly Maguires lay in that deep-seated
hatred of an informer which has become a pronounced
feature of the Irish character, as a result of the conditions
to which they have been subjected at home. Thus,
while the great mass of the Irish settlers of the anthracite
region abhorred the principles and deeds of the
Molly Maguires, it was almost impossible to secure witnesses
against criminals whose identity was a matter of
general knowledge, because of the greater repugnance
to the character of an informer. The traditional hatred
of the Irish peasant towards the landlord was, in this
country, diverted to the capitalist class in a wholly unreasonable
but efficient manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is here, also, a striking demonstration of the
capacity of a relatively small group of turbulent and
unassimilated foreigners so to conduct themselves as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>bring an undeserved disrepute upon their whole group,
and foster economic and social changes in society which
will last on long after they are all dead.<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c018'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>While the Irish and Germans were dominating the
immigration situation on the Atlantic coast, the Chinese
were occupying the center of the stage in the west.
The stream of Chinese immigration became considerable
at about the same time that the great increase in European
immigration was taking place on the other side of
the continent. As to its causes, Mrs. Mary Roberts
Coolidge speaks as follows: “The first effective contact
of China with Western nations was through the Opium
War of 1840, which resulted in an increase of Chinese
taxes, a general disturbance of the laboring classes, and
the penetration of some slight knowledge of European
ideas into the maritime provinces. Although this prepared
the way for the emigration to the West, its precipitating
cause lay in ‘the Golden Romance’ that had
filled the world,”—that is, the news of the discovery
of gold in California. “Masters of foreign vessels afforded
every facility to emigration, distributing placards,
maps, and pamphlets with highly colored accounts of
the Golden Hills.... But behind the opportunity
afforded by foreign shipping and the enticement of the
discovery of gold lay deeper causes for emigration—the
poverty and ruin in which the inhabitants of Southeastern
China were involved by the great Taiping rebellion
which began in the summer of 1850. The terrors
of war, famine, and plundering paralyzed all industry and
trade, and the agricultural classes of the maritime districts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>especially were driven to Hong Kong and Macao.”<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c018'><sup>[99]</sup></a>
By the end of 1852 there were in the neighborhood of
25,000 Chinese on the Pacific coast, almost all of them
in California.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the first few years of their coming, the Chinese
in California were welcomed, and were looked upon with
favor. They were industrious, tractable, and inoffensive,
and were willing to undertake the hard, menial,
and disagreeable forms of labor—partly work generally
done by women—for which native labor was not available
under existing conditions. Their strange manners
and customs aroused nothing more than feelings of
curiosity. But gradually a feeling of opposition to them
began to grow up, fomented by the jealousy and race
prejudice of the miners. Their peculiar appearance
and strange customs began to make them the objects of
suspicion and hatred. This feeling was intensified by
the presence of a large element of southerners in California,
who classed all people of dark skin—“South
Americans, South Europeans, Kanakas, Malays, or
Chinese”—together as colored. Wild stories of their
character and habits began to circulate, and with each
repetition gained strength until they passed current as
facts. Among these were the assertions that the Chinese
were practically all coolies, or labor slaves, that they were
highly immoral and vicious, that they had secret tribunals
which inflicted the death penalty without due
process of law, that they displaced native labor, that
they could not be Christianized, that they had no intention
of remaining as permanent residents of the country
and would not assimilate with the natives, that they
sent money out of the country, etc. Most of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>charges have been proven to be either wholly false
or highly exaggerated by recent investigations, and were
so recognized by the more sober and fair-minded students
of the subject at the time. But for the mass of
the people of the Pacific coast, and for many in other parts
of the country, they acquired all the force of established
dogma, and their reiteration passed for argument.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Chinaman became the scapegoat for all the ills
that afflicted the youthful community, from whatever
cause they really arose, and in time an anti-Chinese
declaration came to be essential for the success of any
political party or candidate. In such a state of public
opinion it was inevitable that their lot should be a hard
one. They were robbed, beaten, murdered, and persecuted
in a variety of ways. The foreign miners’
license tax was used against them in a discriminating
way which amounted to quasi legal plunder.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1876 the California State Legislature appointed a
committee to look into the matter of Chinese immigration
and to make a report. This was done in 1877, and
although the resulting Address and Memorial to Congress
have had a large influence in forming public opinion,
and in shaping legislation, it appears that it was in
fact a purely political document, and that everything
was arranged in advance to secure a report which should
accomplish a certain definite result—the satisfaction of
the workingmen of the state, and the emphasizing of the
necessity of federal legislation. The need of this was
strongly felt, because nearly all the acts passed by the
coast states against the Chinese had been declared
either unconstitutional or a violation of treaty.</p>

<p class='c010'>In response to the repeated demands of the coast states
for some federal action, Congress in 1876 appointed a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>special committee on Chinese immigration, which made
what purported to be a thorough investigation of the
matter, and reported thereupon. The report was wholly
anti-Chinese. But this was inevitable, as it is apparent
from a careful study of the testimony, that the committee
“came to its task committed to an anti-Chinese conclusion
and that it had no judicial character whatever.”<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c018'><sup>[100]</sup></a>
The evidence was willfully distorted to produce the
desired result.</p>

<p class='c010'>During all this time our relations with China had been
nominally subject to a series of treaties, beginning with
that of 1844, and including the famous Burlingame
treaty of 1868. While the earlier agreements did not
specifically mention the rights of Chinese to reside and
trade in the United States, they were in fact allowed the
same privileges in these respects as the citizens of other
nations. By the treaty of 1868, however, the right of
voluntary emigration was definitely recognized as between
the two countries on the basis of the most favored
nation; but the Chinese were not given the right of
naturalization. From this privilege they were definitely
excluded by the law of 1870.</p>

<p class='c010'>It became evident in time that no federal legislation,
satisfactory to the politicians of the western states, could
be secured under the existing treaties. There arose accordingly
a demand for a new treaty which would allow
the passage of laws which would include the points
desired by the western representatives, practically the
exclusion of all Chinese not belonging to the merchant
class. In response to this demand there was negotiated,
after much conference between the representatives of
the two nations, a new treaty in 1880. The most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>important feature of this new instrument was the right
conferred upon the government of the United States
reasonably to regulate, limit, or suspend, but not to
prohibit, the coming or residence of Chinese laborers,
whenever it deemed that the interests of the country
demanded such action. It is under this treaty that the
various Chinese exclusion acts have been passed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first of these acts was passed in 1882, and provided
for the exclusion of Chinese laborers for a period of
ten years. This was not to apply to Chinese who were
already in the country, or who should enter within
ninety days after the passage of the act. Such persons,
who desired to leave the country and return, were required
to secure a certificate, which by an amendatory
act of 1884 was made the sole evidence of the
right of a Chinaman to return. This act also required
a certificate of the exempt classes, to be issued by
the Chinese government or such other foreign governments
as they might be subject to. The deportation
of Chinese unlawfully in the country was also provided
for by these acts.</p>

<p class='c010'>These laws were in many respects carelessly drawn
and extremely difficult of execution. In their application
they entailed great expense upon the United States
government, and worked extreme hardship and injustice
to many Chinese. They were, nevertheless, effective
as regards their main purpose, for the volume of Chinese
immigration at once diminished exceedingly. The strictness
of the exclusion was increased by the act of 1888,
which refused return to any Chinese laborer unless he
had a lawful wife, child, or parent in the United States,
or owned property of the value of $1000 or had debts
due him of like amount. The acts in force were extended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>for another ten years by the act of 1892, and again indefinitely
in 1902, in each case with relatively unimportant
modifications in detail.</p>

<p class='c010'>This history of Chinese immigration is not a matter in
which the citizen of the United States can take much
pride. Race prejudice, bigotry, ignorance, and political
ambition have played a prominent part in the agitation,
and have been instrumental in securing much of the
legislation. The attitude and conduct of the United
States contrasts unfavorably with the position of China,
which has been one of patient, courteous, dignified,
but emphatic protest, and willingness to coöperate in
securing reasonable and beneficial regulation. The boycott
of 1905 has been her principal active reprisal. In
spite of these facts, however, it would be rash to assert
that the exclusion of Chinese laborers, by whatever
unfortunate means accomplished, has not been of actual
benefit to the United States. The assertion that the
failure of the Chinese to assimilate has been due more to
race prejudice and exclusiveness on the part of Americans
than to unwillingness to be Americanized on the part of
the Chinese, does not do away with the fact of nonassimilation.
Until Americans are willing to fraternize on
terms of social equality with members of any race, there
is great danger to national institutions in the presence
of large numbers of that race within the country.<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c018'><sup>[101]</sup></a> And
when we reflect how enormous Chinese immigration
might easily have become in these recent years of quick
and easy transportation, and excessive activity of steamship
agents, contract labor agents, and others of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>kind, it is apparent that if free immigration had been
allowed to these people of a widely diverse race, we might
now be facing a Chinese problem in this country second
in gravity only to the negro question.<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c018'><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>By the end of this period the conditions of life in
America had so changed as to diminish the general feeling
of complacency toward unlimited immigration. There
was in particular a growing opposition to contract labor,
and an increased demand for federal control of the immigration
situation, especially as all state laws in regard
to the regulation of foreign immigration had been declared
unconstitutional in 1876. There was a conviction
in the minds of some thinkers that the United States
no longer stood in need of an increased labor force.
These views were clearly expressed in an article by Mr.
A. B. Mason, published in 1874. Some of his statements
have a new ring. “The conditions that have
hitherto greatly favored immigration no longer exist
in their full force.” “The labour market, <i>especially
for agricultural labour</i>, is overstocked.” “The especial
disadvantages of American labour more than counterbalance
its especial advantages.” “English labour is
in the main as well off as American labour.”<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c018'><sup>[103]</sup></a> It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>evident that the time was at hand when the competition
of the foreigner in the American labor market could
no longer be regarded with equanimity.</p>

<p class='c010'>This sentiment did not bear fruit, however, until
the year 1882. The only federal legislation bearing on
immigration after the repeal of the favorable contract
labor law in 1868 up to this date, was the act of March
3, 1875, prohibiting the importation or immigration
into the United States of women for the purpose of
prostitution, and also prohibiting the immigration of
criminals, convicted of other than political offenses.
This law, while couched in general terms, was an outcome
of the anti-Chinese agitation, and was passed with
this race particularly in mind.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VI<br> <span class='c017'>MODERN PERIOD. FEDERAL LEGISLATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The year 1882 stands as a prominent landmark in
the history of immigration into the United States. In
that year the total immigration reached the figure of
788,992, a point which had never been reached before
and was not reached again until 1903. It witnessed
the climax of the movement from the Scandinavian countries,
and from Germany; only once since then has the
immigration from the United Kingdom reached the
amount of that year. It coincides almost exactly with
the appearance of the streams of immigration from
Italy, Austria-Hungary, and Russia of sufficient volume
to command attention. In that year the first Chinese
exclusion act and the first inclusive federal immigration
law were passed. Consequently the year 1882 stands
as a natural and logical beginning of the modern period
of immigration, a period during which the immigration
movement has been marked by characteristics so peculiarly
new and definite as to distinguish it sharply from
anything which went before. The discussion of immigration
during this period is in all its essentials the discussion
of a present-day problem.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the most distinctive and obvious characteristics
of this period has been the growth of a complicated body
of federal immigration laws. These have put the whole
immigration question on a new basis, and deserve to be
considered in some detail. In the following review, only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>those sections of the successive laws which contain matter
that is of general importance have been included. All
merely technical details and many of the provisions regarding
penalties and the practical administration of the
laws have been omitted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Act of August 3, 1882. <span class='sc'>Section 1.</span> A duty (commonly
known as a head tax) of fifty cents is to be levied
for every passenger not a citizen of the United States,
who comes from any foreign port to any port of the
United States by steam or sail vessel. This duty is to
be paid to the collector of customs of the port, by the
master, owner, agent, or consignee of the vessel within
twenty-four hours after entry. The money so collected
is to constitute an Immigrant Fund, to be used to defray
the expenses of regulating immigration, for the care of
immigrants, and the relief of such as are in distress, and
in general for carrying out the provisions of the act.
This duty is to constitute a lien upon the vessel until
paid.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 2.</span> The Secretary of the Treasury is charged
with the execution of this act, and with supervision
over the business of immigration into the United States.
He is authorized to make contracts with state boards
and commissions, which are still charged with the duty
of examining ships arriving at ports of the state. Any
convict, lunatic, idiot, or any person unable to take care
of himself or herself without becoming a public charge
shall not be permitted to land.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 3.</span> The Secretary of the Treasury is empowered
to make provisions to protect immigrants from
fraud and loss, and to carry out the law.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 4.</span> All foreign convicts, except those convicted
of political offenses, shall be returned to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>nations to which they belong and from which they came.
The expense of returning all persons not permitted to
land is to be borne by the owners of the vessel in which
they came.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 5.</span> This act shall take effect immediately.</p>

<p class='c010'>The salient points of this law are the imposition of a
federal head tax, the beginning of a list of excluded
classes, the return of excluded aliens, at the expense of
the shipowners, and the assignment of the immigration
business to the Secretary of the Treasury, the actual
work of examination, however, still being done by the
state boards.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next act bearing on immigration was Section 22
of the act of June 26, 1884, and was designed to correct
a discrimination in favor of land transportation contained
in Section 1 of the act of 1882. It provided
that until the provisions of this section should be made
applicable to passengers coming into the United States
by land carriage, they should not apply to passengers
coming in vessels trading exclusively between ports of
the United States and Canada and Mexico.</p>

<p class='c010'>Act of February 26, 1885. <span class='sc'>Section 1.</span> It shall be
“unlawful for any person, company, partnership, or
corporation, in any manner whatsoever, to prepay the
transportation, or in any way to assist or encourage the
importation or migration of any alien or aliens, any
foreigner or foreigners, into the United States, its Territories,
or the District of Columbia, under contract or
agreement, parol or special, express or implied, made
previously to the importation or migration of such alien
or aliens, foreigner or foreigners, to perform labor or
service of any kind in the United States, its Territories,
or the District of Columbia.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span><span class='sc'>Section 2.</span> All contracts of the above nature shall be
void.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 3.</span> Provides for a fine of $1000 for every
violation of the above provision, payable for each alien
being party to such a contract.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 4.</span> The master of any vessel who knowingly
brings in contract laborers shall be fined not more than
$500, and may also be imprisoned for not more than six
months.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 5.</span> The following classes shall be excepted
from the provisions of the above sections: secretaries,
servants, and domestics of foreigners temporarily residing
in the United States; skilled workmen for any industry
not now established in the United States, provided that
such labor cannot be otherwise obtained; actors, artists,
lecturers or singers, or persons employed strictly as
personal or domestic servants. This act shall not prevent
any individual from assisting any member of his
family or any relative or personal friend to come in for
the purpose of settlement.</p>

<p class='c010'>On February 23, 1887, there was an amendatory act
passed to the above act, specifically intrusting the
Secretary of the Treasury with the carrying out of its
provisions, and providing for the return of contract
laborers in a manner similar to other excluded classes.</p>

<p class='c010'>On October 19, 1888, the law of 1887 was amended,
providing that a person who has entered the country
contrary to the contract labor law, may be deported
within one year at the expense of the owner of the importing
vessel, or if he came by land, of the person contracting
for his services.</p>

<p class='c010'>The section containing the provision for excluding
contract laborers has been quoted verbatim to emphasize
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>its extremely strict and inclusive wording. It would be
very difficult for any person who had the slightest idea
of what he was going to do in this country to prove himself
outside the letter of that law. The softening clauses
of the law are put in the form of exceptions, thus throwing
the burden of the proof upon the immigrant. The last
amendment quoted is of especial interest as introducing
the principle of deportation after landing.<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c018'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Act of March 3, 1891. <span class='sc'>Section 1.</span> The following additions
are made to the excluded classes: paupers or
persons likely to become a public charge, persons suffering
from a loathsome or a contagious disease, polygamists,
and any person whose ticket or passage is paid
for with the money of another, or who is assisted by
others to come, unless it is specifically proved that he
does not belong to one of the excluded classes, including
contract laborers.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 3.</span> Assisting or encouraging immigration by
promise of employment through advertising in a foreign
country is declared illegal, with the exception of the advertisements
of state agencies.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span><span class='sc'>Section 4.</span> Encouragement or solicitation of immigration
by steamship or transportation companies, except
by means of regular advertisements giving an
account of sailings, facilities, and terms is declared
illegal.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 5.</span> The following are added to the excepted
classes under the contract labor law: ministers of any
religious denomination, persons belonging to any recognized
profession, professors of colleges and seminaries.
Relatives and friends of persons in this country are not
hereafter to be excepted.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 6.</span> Persons bringing in aliens not legally entitled
to enter are made liable to a fine of not more than
$1000, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or
both.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 7.</span> The office of Superintendent of Immigration
is created, to be under the Secretary of the
Treasury.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 8.</span> Shipmasters shall file with the proper
officers a manifest, giving the name, nationality, last
residence, and destination of each alien passenger. Inspection
is to be made by inspection officers before landing,
or a temporary landing may be made at a specified
place. The medical examination is to be made by surgeons
of the Marine Hospital Service. During the
temporary landing, aliens are to be properly fed and
cared for. Right of appeal granted. Landing, or allowing
to land, alien passengers at any other time or place
than that specified by the inspectors is made an offense
punishable by a (maximum) fine of $1000, or imprisonment
for one year, or both. The Secretary of the Treasury
is empowered to prescribe rules for the inspection of
immigrants along the borders of Canada, British Columbia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>and Mexico. The duties and powers previously
vested in the state boards are now to go to the regular
inspection officers of the United States.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 10.</span> All aliens who unlawfully come to the
United States are to be immediately sent back on the
vessel in which they came, all expenses in the meantime
to be borne by the shipowner.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 11.</span> Any alien who comes into the United
States in violation of law may be deported within one
year, and any alien who becomes a public charge within
one year after landing, from causes existing prior to this
landing, may be deported. The expenses of all deportations
are to be borne by the transportation agency responsible
for bringing in the immigrant, if that is possible,
and if not, by the United States.</p>

<p class='c010'>The items in this act particularly worthy of notice
are the following: extension of the excluded classes;
prohibition of encouraging immigration by advertising
or solicitation, an attempt to cure two serious evils, the
success of which we shall have occasion to note later;
relatives and personal friends in this country no longer
excepted from the contract labor clause (this exception
had almost vitiated the former law); requirement of
manifests; the complete assumption of the work of
inspection by the federal government; extension of the
principle of deportation to public charges.</p>

<p class='c010'>Act of March 3, 1893. <span class='sc'>Section 1.</span> Manifests greatly
enlarged in detail.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 2.</span> Alien passengers are to be listed in convenient
groups of not more than thirty each, and given
tickets corresponding to their numbers on the manifests.
The master of the vessel must certify that he and the
ship’s surgeon have made an examination of all the immigrants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>before sailing, and believe none of them to belong
to the excluded classes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 3.</span> If the ship has no surgeon, examination
must be made by a competent surgeon hired by the
transportation company.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 5.</span> Immigrants who are not beyond any doubt
entitled to land are to be held for special inquiry by a
board of not less than four inspectors.</p>

<p class='c010'>The noteworthy features in this law are examination
at the expense of the company at the port of embarkation,
listing the immigrants in groups of thirty, the institution
of the boards of special inquiry.</p>

<p class='c010'>August 18, 1894. Head tax is raised to $1.</p>

<p class='c010'>March 2, 1895. The Superintendent of Immigration
is hereafter to be designated the Commissioner General
of Immigration.</p>

<p class='c010'>June 6, 1900. The Commissioner General of Immigration
is made responsible for the administration of the
Chinese Exclusion Acts.</p>

<p class='c010'>March 3, 1903. <i>Section 1.</i> The head tax is raised
to $2, and is not to apply to citizens of Canada, Cuba,
or Mexico.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 2.</span> The following are added to the debarred
classes: epileptics, persons who have been insane within
five years previous, persons who have had two or more
attacks of insanity at any time previously; professional
beggars, anarchists, or persons who believe in or advocate
the overthrow by force or violence of the government of
the United States, or of all government or of all forms of
law, or the assassination of public officials; prostitutes,
and persons who procure or attempt to bring in prostitutes
or women for the purpose of prostitution; those
who, within one year, have been deported under the contract
labor clause.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span><span class='sc'>Section 3.</span> The importation of prostitutes is forbidden
under a (maximum) penalty of five years’ imprisonment
and a fine of $5000.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 9.</span> The bringing in of any person afflicted
with a loathsome or a dangerous contagious disease
by any person or company, except railway lines, is
forbidden. A fine of $100 is attached if it appears
that the disease might have been detected at the time
of embarkation.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 11.</span> If a rejected alien is helpless from sickness,
physical disability, or infancy, and is accompanied
by an alien whose protection is required, both shall be
returned in the usual way.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 20.</span> The period of deportation for aliens who
have come into this country in violation of law, including
those who have become public charges within two
years after landing, is raised to two years.</p>

three years is made for the above classes of aliens, with
the exception of public charges.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 24.</span> The appointment of immigration inspectors
and other employees is put under the Civil
Service rules.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 25.</span> The boards of special inquiry are to consist
of three members. Either the alien or any dissenting
member of the board may appeal.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 39.</span> Anarchists, etc., are not to be naturalized.</p>

<p class='c010'>The important features of this act are the further extension
of the excluded classes; special attention and
penalties with respect to prostitutes; the period of deportation
raised to two and three years.</p>

<p class='c010'>Act of February 14, 1903. The Department of Commerce
and Labor is created, and the Commissioner General
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>of Immigration is transferred to it from the Treasury
Department.</p>

<p class='c010'>March 22, 1904. Newfoundland is added to the
countries exempt from the head tax.</p>

<p class='c010'>June 29, 1906. The Bureau of Immigration is henceforth
to be called the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization,
and is to have charge of the business of naturalization.
A register is to be kept at immigration stations,
giving full information in regard to all aliens arriving in
the United States.</p>

<p class='c010'>On February 20, 1907, there was passed an inclusive
immigration law, designed to include all of the previous
laws, and repealing such provisions of earlier laws as
are not consistent with the present law. The principal
changes introduced by the new law are as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 1.</span> The head tax is raised to $4. It is not
to be levied on aliens who have resided for at least
one year immediately preceding, in Canada, Newfoundland,
Cuba, or Mexico, nor on aliens in transit through
the United States.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 2.</span> To the excluded classes are added imbeciles,
feeble-minded persons, persons afflicted with
tuberculosis, persons not included in any of the specifically
excluded classes who have a mental or physical
deficiency which may affect their ability to earn a living,
persons who admit having committed a crime involving
moral turpitude, persons who admit their belief in the
practice of polygamy, women or girls coming into the
United States for the purpose of prostitution, or for
any other immoral purpose, or persons who attempt to
bring in such women or girls, and all children under the
age of sixteen unaccompanied by one or both of their
parents, at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>and Labor. Persons whose tickets are paid for with
the money of another must show affirmatively that
they were not paid for by any corporation, society, association,
municipality, or foreign government, either
directly or indirectly. This is not to apply to aliens in
continuous transit through the United States to foreign
contiguous territory.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 3.</span> The harboring of immoral women and
girls in houses of prostitution, or any other place for
purposes of prostitution, within a period of three years
after their arrival, is made an offense punishable in the
same manner as importing them. Such women are
liable to deportation within three years.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 9.</span> A fine of $100 is imposed on any person
bringing in aliens subject to any of the following disabilities:
idiots, imbeciles, epileptics, or persons afflicted
with tuberculosis (or with a loathsome or dangerous
contagious disease), if these existed and might
have been detected previous to embarkation.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 12.</span> It is made the duty of shipmasters
taking alien passengers out of the United States to furnish
a report, before sailing, giving the name, age, sex,
nationality, residence in the United States, occupation,
and time of last arrival in the United States of each such
alien passenger.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 20.</span> All deportations may be within three
years.<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c018'><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Section 25.</span> Appeal from a decision of a board of
special inquiry may be made by the rejected alien or by
any member of the board, through the commissioner of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the port and the Commissioner General of Immigration
to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, except in

<p class='c010'>The especially noteworthy features of this act are the
following: further extension of the excluded classes;
more stringent provisions regarding immoral women, and
their managers; the fine for bringing in inadmissible
aliens extended to other classes; the beginning of statistics
of departing aliens; appeal not allowed from the
decision of a board of special inquiry in case of mental
or physical disability; Immigration Commission authorized;
Division of Information established.</p>

<p class='c010'>The only important addition to immigration legislation
since this act is the act of March 26, 1910, by which
there were added to the excluded and deportable classes
“persons who are supported by or receive in full or in part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>the proceeds of prostitution.” The three-year limit for
deportation was removed as regards sexually immoral
aliens. Closely connected with this phase of the immigration
statutes is a recent act prohibiting the importation
from one state to another of persons for the purpose
of prostitution. In accordance with an act just passed
(1913) the business of immigration and naturalization
passes over to the newly created Department of Labor.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have seen that up to 1882 practically all the federal
acts relating to immigration had to do with the regulation
of steerage conditions. Until the year 1907 these acts,
which were encouraging in tendency, were always considered
as a separate body of legislation from the real immigration
laws, which were primarily restrictive in character.
In the act of that year, however, the control
of the steerage was included in the immigration law,
where it logically belonged. There had been one or two
important pieces of steerage legislation passed previous
to this time which we have not as yet noticed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The last important steerage act which has been noted
was the act of 1855. The principal law between that
date and 1907 was the act of 1882. “Viewed from the
standpoint of its predecessors the passenger act of 1882
was an excellent measure. Its framers had profited
by observing the results of the legislative experiments of
about sixty-two years. This advantage, together with
the marvelous development and progress in the methods
of passenger traffic, enabled the lawmakers to draft
an intelligent and comprehensive bill. By its provisions
the safety and comfort of emigrants were, theoretically
at least, assured. No deck less than 6 feet in height on
any vessel was allowed to be used for passengers. On
the main deck and the deck next below 100 cubic feet of air
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>space was allowed each passenger, and on the second
deck below the main deck 120 cubic feet was allowed each
person. Decks other than the three above mentioned
were under no circumstances to be used for passengers.
With the development of shipbuilding, however, other
decks were added to ships, and this provision soon became
obsolete. Sufficient berths for all passengers were to be
provided, the dimensions of each berth to be not less than
2 feet in width and 6 feet in length, with suitable partitions
dividing them. The sexes were to be properly
separated. The steerage was to be amply supplied with
fresh air by means of modern approved ventilators.
Three cooked meals, consisting of wholesome food, were
to be served regularly each day. Each ship was to have
a fully equipped modern hospital for the use of sick passengers.
A competent physician was to be in attendance
and suitable medicines were to be carried. The ship’s
master was authorized to enforce such rules and regulations
as would promote habits of cleanliness and good
health. Dangerous articles, such as highly explosive
substances and powerful acids, were forbidden on
board.”<a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c018'><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The above act remained in force until 1907, when it
was superseded by Section 42 of the immigration act of
that year. By this law the cubic air space system of
the act of 1882 was abandoned in favor of the superficial
area system of preventing overcrowding. Eighteen
clear feet of deck space on the main deck or the deck
next below were to be provided for each passenger, and
20 feet on the second deck below. If the height between
the lower passenger deck and the one next above
was less than 7 feet, there must be 30 clear feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>of deck space per passenger. There was also provision
for light and ventilation. No passengers were to be
carried on any other decks than those mentioned.</p>

<p class='c010'>This act was unsatisfactory, as there was much uncertainty
as to which was the main deck, inasmuch as ships
with as many as eight decks were carrying immigrants.
The British law was superior in this respect. It specified
the lowest passenger deck as the one next below the water
line. All above this were denominated passenger decks.
This law required 18 clear superficial feet for each passenger
carried on the lowest passenger deck, and 15 feet
for each passenger on passenger decks. If the height
of the lowest passenger deck was less than 7 feet, or if it
was not properly lighted and ventilated, there must be
25 feet per passenger, and under similar conditions on
passenger decks, 18 feet. There must be 5 feet of
superficial open deck space for each passenger. In
reckoning the space on the lowest passenger deck and
passenger decks the space occupied by the baggage of passengers,
public rooms, lavatories, and bathrooms used
exclusively by steerage passengers might be counted,
provided the actual sleeping space was not less than 15
feet on the lowest and 12 feet on the others. On December
19, 1908, the United States passed a law making
our steerage provisions correspond with the British act,
except that the last provisions are 18 feet and 15
feet respectively in the United States law.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the practical application of such a complicated set
of laws as these it is inevitable that many questions and
uncertainties should arise. For the guidance of immigration
officials in the performance of their duties, a long
list of rules and regulations are prescribed by the Commissioner
General. A few of these, which have an immediate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>bearing on the admission of aliens must be noted.
Stowaways are considered <i>ipso facto</i> inadmissible, and
as a rule are not even examined. Certain border ports
are specified on the Canadian and Mexican borders, and
any alien entering at any other port is assumed to have
entered in violation of law. All aliens arriving in Canada,
destined to the United States, are inspected at one of the
following ports: Halifax, Nova Scotia; Quebec and
Point Levi, Quebec; St. John, New Brunswick; Vancouver
and Victoria, British Columbia. The United
States maintains inspection stations at these points, and
aliens examined there are given a certificate stating that
the alien has been inspected and is admissible, accompanied
by a personal description for purposes of identification.
Special boards of inquiry are also established
in other border cities for the examination of aliens,
originally destined for Canada, but who later desire to be
admitted to the United States within one year after
their arrival in Canada. Aliens entering the United
States by Mexican border ports are, in general, subject
to the same inspection as if arriving by a seaport.</p>

<p class='c010'>Aliens in transit are examined in the same manner as
if desiring to remain in the United States, and if they are
found to belong to the debarred classes they are refused
permission to land. The head tax is charged on their
account, as for other aliens, but it is refunded to the
transportation company if the latter furnishes satisfactory
proof that the alien has passed by a continuous
journey through the territory of the United States,
within thirty days, such proof to be furnished within
sixty days after the arrival of the alien.</p>

<p class='c010'>Throughout the development of this body of laws
certain well-marked tendencies can be traced. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>first place, the criteria of admission have steadily increased
in severity, until now the law provides for the
exclusion of practically every class of applicants who
might fairly be considered undesirable, with the exception,
perhaps, of illiterates. Secondly, we may note a
tendency to concentrate all business, connected with the
admission of aliens into this country or into membership
in the nation, in the hands of a single branch of the federal
government, and the increasing power and importance
of this branch. Thirdly, there is manifest an increasing
recognition of the right of this country to protect itself
against unwelcome additions to its population, not only
by refusing them admission, but by expelling them from
the country, if their subsequent conduct proves them
unworthy of retention.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VII<br> <span class='c017'>VOLUME AND RACIAL COMPOSITION OF THE IMMIGRATION STREAM</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>As regards the volume of the immigration current the
modern period has witnessed a continuation of the same
general process which has been going on since 1820.
The same succession of crests and depressions in the
great wave has continued, the only difference being that
the apex reached a much higher point than ever before.
And, as in other periods, the great determining factor in
the volume of immigration has been the economic situation
in this country. Prosperity has always been attended
by large immigration, hard times by the reverse.
As already remarked, the year 1882 was marked by the
largest annual immigration which had hitherto been
recorded. The next low-water mark was reached in the
middle nineties, following the depression of 1893. As
the country recovered from this, immigration began to
increase again, and rose almost steadily until in 1907
it reached the highest record which it has ever attained,
a grand total of 1,285,349 immigrants in one year.<a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c018'><sup>[108]</sup></a>
The crisis of that year interrupted the course of affairs,
and immigration fell off sharply, and has not since completely
recovered.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is one matter connected with the volume of
immigration which marks the last few years of the
modern period and is of the greatest importance. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>is the provision for estimating the exact net gain or loss
in population each year through immigration movements.
Until very recently the only immigration figures
which were considered worth while were those of arriving
aliens. It was tacitly assumed that our immigrant
traffic was a wholly one-sided one. But gradually
people began to realize that there was a large countercurrent
of departing aliens. In the Report of the Commissioner
General of Immigration for 1906 (p. 56) an
effort is made to supply as far as possible these data for
the years 1890 to 1906. But in the absence of any
legislation requiring shipmasters to furnish lists of departing
passengers, these figures are admittedly incomplete,
and no attempt is made to distinguish aliens from
citizens of the United States. The nearest approach
that can be made to ascertaining the number of departing
aliens is to assume that all the passengers other than
cabin belonged to this class. This is probably not very
far from the truth, and taking these figures as a guide,
we can get some idea of how large the outward movement
has been at certain times, particularly during the
period of commercial depression which marked the middle
nineties. Thus in 1895 while there were 258,536 arrivals
of immigrant aliens, there were 216,665 departures
of the class mentioned, making a total gain of only
41,871; in 1898 the net gain was only 98,442 against a total
immigration of 229,299. Unfortunately, figures are not
available for 1896–1897. The importance of this phase
of the subject eventually became so evident that in the
immigration law of 1907 a provision was included requiring
masters of departing vessels to file accurate and
detailed lists of their alien passengers, giving certain
important facts concerning them. Accordingly, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>fiscal year 1908 we have for the first time complete and
accurate data regarding departing aliens.</p>

<p class='c010'>In that year another important distinction is made,
that between immigrant and nonimmigrant aliens on
the inward passage, and emigrant and nonemigrant aliens
on the outward passage. Immigrant aliens are those
whose place of last permanent residence was in some
foreign country, and who are coming here with the intention
of residing permanently. Nonimmigrant aliens
are of two classes: those whose place of last permanent
residence was the United States, but who have been
abroad for a short period of time, and those whose place
of last permanent residence was in a foreign country,
and who are coming to the United States without the
intention of residing permanently, including aliens in
transit. Departing aliens are classified in a corresponding
way. Emigrant aliens are those whose place of last
permanent residence was the United States, and who are
going abroad with the intention of residing there permanently.
Nonemigrant aliens are of two classes: those
whose place of last permanent residence was the United
States, and who are going abroad for a short visit only,
and those whose place of last permanent residence was
abroad, but who have been in the United States for
a short time, including aliens in transit. In all cases the
expressed intention of the alien is regarded as final concerning
residence, and an intended future residence of
twelve months is considered a permanent residence.
The recent reports of the Commissioner General contain
tables almost as detailed for departing as for arriving
aliens.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus it is now possible to make an exact reckoning of
the net gain or loss in population each year through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>immigration movements. The classes in which we are
particularly interested are naturally the immigrant and
emigrant aliens, for they are the only participants in
true immigration movements, according to our definition.
The others are merely travelers. Yet they are important
and interesting travelers, and the modern problems of
immigration cannot be thoroughly understood without
taking some consideration of them. As for the aliens in
transit, they can be quickly disposed of. They are
counted as nonimmigrant aliens on their arrival, and
nonemigrant aliens at their departure, which is supposed
to occur within a period of thirty days. Thus they
cancel, and do not in any important way affect the life
of the United States. The other class of nonimmigrants
and nonemigrants is much more important, for they
include a group of aliens who have attracted considerable
attention of late—the so-called “birds of passage.”
These are, in the strictest sense, aliens who have chosen
the United States as their place of permanent residence,
but who go back to the old country for brief sojourns on
certain occasions. In a broader sense, the birds of
passage may also be taken to include aliens whose permanent
residence is abroad, but who come to this country
for a brief stay.<a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c018'><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>As an illustration of the method of reckoning the gain
or loss in population, let us take the year 1910. In that
year there were 1,041,570 immigrant aliens, and 156,467
nonimmigrant aliens admitted, making a total of
1,198,037. There were 202,436 departures of emigrant
aliens and 177,982 of nonemigrant aliens, making a total
of 380,418. Thus there was a net gain in the year of
817,619 aliens all together. But not all of these were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>permanent residents. To get an idea of the actual increase
of permanent residents we need to add together
two classes,—the immigrant aliens, who come here for
the first time with the intention of residing permanently,
and those nonimmigrant aliens who are such, not because
they do not expect to reside here permanently,
but because their permanent residence has already been
established here and who have been abroad for a brief
period. Of the former class, the immigrant aliens, there
were 1,041,570; of the second class, nonimmigrants
whose places of last permanent residence and of intended
future residence were both the United States, there were
94,075. This makes a total of 1,135,645 permanent
alien residents who came into the United States in the
year in question. The actual decrease in permanent
residents may be computed in a similar way. In the
year in question there were 202,436 emigrant aliens who
departed, and 89,754 nonemigrant aliens whose places of
last permanent residence and intended future residence
were both the United States,—that is, permanent
residents of this country who left for a brief period only.
This makes a total of 292,190 permanent residents of
this country who left it in the year in question. Subtracting
this number from the total of permanent residents
who arrived, we have a remainder of 843,455.
This represents the actual gain in permanent alien residents
during the year in question. This figure, in the
year in question, happens to come very near to the gross
gain estimated in the simplest way. But it is not necessarily
so, and in the year 1908 there was considerable
difference between the two figures. It is not always
necessary to make this somewhat involved calculation.
In many cases, the mere comparison of the figures for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>immigrant and emigrant aliens is sufficient for the purpose.
But there are many other instances in which
accuracy and consistency require this exact calculation
to be made, and it is a decided acquisition to the study of
immigration to have these data available.<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c018'><sup>[110]</sup></a> Thus in
the year 1909 the net gain in permanent alien residents
was 584,513, while in 1908 it was only 341,075; yet
there were more immigrant aliens admitted in 1908 than
in 1909.</p>

<p class='c010'>In respect to the composition of this great current,
the period in question has witnessed a profound and most
significant change. We have seen that prior to 1882
practically the entire body of immigrants was made up
of individuals from Germany, the United Kingdom, and
the Scandinavian countries. From that year on, these
have steadily decreased in importance, and their places
have been taken by contingents from Italy, Austria-Hungary,
Russia, and other south European countries.
This change has been so pronounced as to lead to a separation
of immigrants into the “old immigration” and the
“new immigration,” a distinction which has become
familiar to every casual student of the subject. The
Immigration Commission has recently given its official
sanction to this classification, and in its reports follows
this scheme: the old immigration includes those from
England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Belgium, Denmark,
France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,
and Switzerland; the new immigration, those from
Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Montenegro,
Poland, Portugal, Roumania, Russia, Servia, Spain,
Syria, and Turkey. This schedule refers only to
European countries (with the exception of Syria and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Turkey, which ethnically belong to Europe), without
reference to non-European sources. But immigration
to the United States is as yet almost wholly a European
movement, so that other countries may be neglected in
any general consideration. In so far as there are any
immigrants from non-European sources they would
naturally be classed with the new immigration. Roughly
speaking, the old immigration came from the north and
west of Europe, the new immigration comes from the
south and east of that continent.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sweeping nature of this change can be comprehended
only through the comparison of figures. The
immigration from the United Kingdom and Germany,
which up to 1882 had made up so nearly all of the total,
never again reached the same figure, and gradually
dwindled, both relatively and positively, until in 1907
it amounted to only 11.8 per cent of the total immigration
for the year. On the other hand the currents
from Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Russia, all of which,
as we have seen, began to attain prominence approximately
in 1882, grew steadily until in the year 1907 they
amounted respectively to 26.3 per cent, 22.2 per cent,
and 20.1 per cent of the total. Putting them together,
we have a total for these three countries of 68.6 per cent
of the total immigration, and adding to them the immigration
from the other countries belonging to the new
movement, we have a total of 81 per cent of the European
immigrants admitted to the United States in 1907. In
the years from 1819 to 1883 the old immigration had
furnished about 95 per cent of the total movement from
Europe to the United States. Comparing the two
years 1882 and 1907, it appears that the old immigration
made up 87.1 per cent of the total immigration in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>first year, and 19 per cent in the latter, and the new
immigration 12.9 per cent in the former and 81 per cent
in the latter.<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c018'><sup>[111]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>This is a most radical change, the importance of which
can hardly be overestimated. The old immigrants, as
we have before observed, were of a racial stock very
closely related to the early settlers of the country, and to
the original type of the American people. Their language
was the same or similar, and their national traditions
wholly harmonious. Consequently assimilation was
a comparatively simple matter. It was practically a reforming,
on American soil, of the English race, from the
same component elements which had gone into it from
the beginning in England. The new immigration is
made up from people of a very different racial stock,
representing the Slavic and Mediterranean branches
of the Caucasian race rather than the Teutonic. With
the difference in race go differences in mental characteristics,
traditions, and habits of life. As a result, the
problem of assimilation in this country has taken on a
completely different aspect. Moreover, this change is a
very recent one. It was not until the year 1896 that the
three currents from Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Russia
exceeded in volume the contributions of the United
Kingdom, Germany, and Scandinavia. The real dilution
of the original American stock is a matter of scarcely
half a generation. These facts will become clearer by
glancing at the following table:</p>

<p class='c010'>In seeking to determine the causes of this change it
will be well to note first certain general causes which
have underlain the whole movement, and then to consider
the specific causes which have operated to stimulate
immigration in certain of the more important countries.</p>

<p class='c010'>Among the general causes may be mentioned first of
all the great development of transportation during the
last thirty years. As has been previously observed,
emigration movements are very dependent upon easy and
cheap transportation facilities. One great reason why
there were so many more immigrants from the United
Kingdom, France, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries,
during the first three quarters of the nineteenth
century, was that communication between those countries
and the United States was so much easier than
with southeastern Europe. The latter part of this century
saw the establishment of many direct steamship
lines from Mediterranean ports to the United
States, which served to open up this new territory.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>There was also a great improvement in internal
transportation in the more backward countries of
Europe, which completed the line of access from the
United States to the more remote interior districts of
Europe.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the establishment of these new lines of communication,
it followed inevitably that the transportation
companies should put forth every effort to attract
as much business as possible to them. So we find the
activities of transportation and emigration agents extending
farther and farther into Europe, with the growth
of lines that demanded their services. The importance
of these agents in stimulating emigration will be discussed
in another connection. Along with these changes,
and incident to the beginnings of emigration from some
of these new sources, there grew up in these countries
a better knowledge of the United States, its attractions,
and the means of getting there. This knowledge was
very meager and faulty at first, and willfully distorted
by the agents, but it served to awaken the people to the
possibilities of emigration, and to stimulate them to take
the step. This influence was abetted by a growing sense
of independence and ambition on the part of the people
of these regions, which made it more possible for them
to act on their own initiative. They could never have
emigrated under the conditions of difficulty, uncertainty,
and hardship which marked the earlier movement, and
which the more hardy, adventurous, and daring northern
races faced without hesitation.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are two further causes of this shifting of the
sources of immigration from northern to southern
Europe, which are even more significant than the foregoing.
The first of these is that, with the filling up of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>the United States, and the industrial improvements of
northern Europe, the economic situation in this country
no longer presents the same marked advantages over the
older nations that it did during most of the nineteenth
century. The immigrant from England, Ireland, Germany,
or Sweden no longer finds his lot so much easier
here than at home. The United States has now its
own problems of congestion, pauperism, and competition
of labor. Consequently it is much less worth while for
the northern immigrant to come. But as compared with
the more backward countries of Europe, there is still a
sufficient margin of advantage in the United States to
make it well worth while for the peasant to make the
change. The comparison of the conditions which exist,
or which he believes to exist, in the United States, with
those in his own land has still sufficient power to
arouse those feelings of discontent which are necessary
to migration.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second of these causes is that when the representatives
of more backward countries, representing a lower
standard of living and of industrial demands, have once
begun to come, the members of more advanced races
cease coming. They are unwilling to take up residence
in a country where they must enter into competition with
their inferiors, and where all will be classed together by
the natives. Our immigration started from the most
advanced nations of Europe. Each inferior reservoir
which we have successively tapped, and allowed to drain
freely into our nation, has tended to check the flow
from the earlier sources. This will continue to be true
to the end. Canada recognizes this fact frankly,
and while making every effort to attract immigrants
from the United Kingdom and northwestern Europe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>places serious obstacles in the way of immigrants from
the other half of the continent.<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c018'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In considering the specific causes of the rise of the new
immigration we will confine our attention primarily to
the countries of Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Russia,
which send us the great bulk of the immigrants, and in
which conditions are sufficiently representative to give a
satisfactory idea of the nature of the new movement in
general. Let us first consider Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p class='c010'>The early immigration from Bohemia in the middle
of the nineteenth century belongs in every way rather to
the old than to the new immigration, and need not be considered
here. As for the recent immigration from Austria-Hungary,
it may be said that the underlying, fundamental
factor is the racial diversity which characterizes
that country. Austria-Hungary is not in any sense a
nation, but a mixture of diverse and hostile races, held
together primarily by the outside pressure of Russia,
Germany, Italy, and Turkey. The attempt to get a
clear and definite understanding of the racial composition
of the empire is baffling to one who has not had the
opportunity to make an exhaustive study of the situation
at first hand, and even the authorities do not
wholly agree as to the racial classification. The following
sketch, taken from Professor Commons,<a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c018'><sup>[113]</sup></a> will give a sufficient
idea of the complicated conditions which exist.
In the territory of Austria-Hungary may be found considerable
numbers of five important sections of the
human family, as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>German.</p>

<p class='c010'>Slav: Czechs or Bohemians, Moravians, Slovaks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Poles, and Ruthenians in the northern part; Croatians,
Servians, Dalmatians, and Slovenians in the southern
part.</p>

<p class='c010'>Magyar.</p>

<p class='c010'>Latin: Italians and Roumanians (Latinized Slavs).</p>

<p class='c010'>Jewish.</p>

<p class='c010'>From such a conglomeration of races it is impossible
that political and social entanglements and difficulties
should not arise. In the words of Miss Balch, “Politically,
the dual monarchy is nothing short of a monstrosity.”<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c018'><sup>[114]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In general, the Germans and Magyars are the ruling
element, and the Slavs are held in subjection. The
former races constitute the nobility, and own the land;
the latter are the peasants and laborers. The management
of public and private financial affairs has largely
been monopolized by the Jews, who have been more
liberally treated here than in any other country of modern
Europe. Along with this political inequality there has
gone a pronounced economic inequality, and while
universal manhood suffrage has recently been granted
by the emperor, it yet remains to be seen whether it will
bring about an improvement of the economic conditions,
which are the great immediate stimulus to emigration.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the greatest blights of Austria-Hungary is the
system of landlordism, and the antiquated system of
landholding and agriculture, which still persists, and
seriously handicaps the country in competition with
more advanced nations. These economic disabilities
are accompanied by various social and political disturbances.
Taxes are high and fall unequally upon
different classes of the population, exempting the great
landowners from their fair share of the burden. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>terms of military service are severe. The birth rate and
death rate are both high, and the poverty, ignorance,
inequality, and helplessness of the people make the overpopulation
seem greater than it is. The emigration is
almost wholly from the peasant class, which does not,
however, represent the lowest section of the population.
Below the peasant in the social scale are the cottager,
the laborer, and the farm servant.</p>

<p class='c010'>We thus have, in the case of Austria-Hungary, an interesting
combination of economic, political, and social
causes, all resting upon racial heterogeneity.<a id='r115'></a><a href='#f115' class='c018'><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Turning to Italy, we find somewhat the same combination
of economic and political causes, without, however, a
corresponding basis of racial diversity. It is true that
the population of Italy is divided into two distinct
groups, but these are also geographically separated, and
the result is a dual stream of immigration, rather than a
single outflow due to racial antagonism. The inhabitants
of northern Italy, the “north Italians” as they are
called, are Teutonic in blood and in appearance. Their
home is in a relatively well-developed manufacturing
section, and a large proportion of the emigrants are
skilled artisans, and come from the cities. The southern
Italians belong to the Mediterranean branch of the Caucasian
race, are shorter in stature and more swarthy,
and on the whole much inferior in intelligence to their
northern compatriots. The majority of the emigrants
are peasants from the great landed estates, accustomed
to wages about one third of those in the north. Naturally
the conditions which lead to emigration are somewhat
different in the north and the south, and it is in the latter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>region that we are particularly interested, for, unfortunately
from our point of view, the great majority of
our Italian immigrants belong to the southern branch.
The distinction between these two groups is so marked
that for years the immigration authorities of the United
States have recognized it, and have listed them separately
in the statistics. In 1910 there were 192,673
south Italian immigrants to this country, and only
30,780 north Italians. The north Italians go to Argentina,
Uruguay, and Brazil in about the same numbers
that the south Italians come to us.</p>

<p class='c010'>In southern Italy and Sicily the power of the landlord,
which as in Austria-Hungary is one of the great curses
of Italy, is greatest. The land is divided up into large
estates held by the nobility, and let out to tenant farmers
at enormously high rents. As much as $160 per year
per acre is paid for an orange garden. The leases are
short. The wages of all classes are very low. An
agricultural laborer earns from 8 cents to 38 cents per day,
an unskilled laborer from 25 cents to 50 cents, and a
skilled laborer, such as a mason or carpenter, from
27 cents to $1.40.<a id='r116'></a><a href='#f116' class='c018'><sup>[116]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>It is true that prices are lower than in the United
States, so that these wages are not so extremely inadequate
as might at first appear. Nevertheless, the difference
between prices in this country and in Italy is not
nearly so great as the difference in wages, so that the
wage scale is in fact much lower there. Living expenses
are seriously increased by an exaggerated system of indirect
taxes, which are so severe in the case of food as
to make food alone cost the peasants about 85 per
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>cent of their wages. These taxes are so arranged as to
fall with undue weight upon the poor and working classes,
forcing them to pay over one half of the entire amount of
taxes. The amount thus paid, exclusive of the tax on
wine, amounts to from 10 to 20 per cent of their
wages. Moreover, this is an increasing burden. Since
1870 the wealth of the country has increased 17 per
cent and taxes 30 per cent.</p>

<p class='c010'>The army and navy are a tremendous drain upon the
people, in two ways. First, they vastly increase the
national expenditures. The money spent for this purpose
amounts to one fourth more of the national income
than is spent by France or Germany, and nearly three
times as much as by the United States. Secondly, they
interfere with production, as every able-bodied peasant
is required to serve in the army for a term of two years.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another, and more profound, cause of economic distress
is found in the rapid increase of population. This is
both a cause and a result of poverty, and the birth rate
is highest in the poorest districts. While this high
birth rate is accompanied by a high death rate, there is
still difference enough between the two to bring about an
extreme density of population, exceeded only by the
islands of Great Britain and Japan, and the states of
Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and the little country
of Belgium. In such a densely populated country, where
both the birth rate and death rate are high, we are almost
always sure to find economic pressure and distress.<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c018'><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>As a result of the foregoing conditions, the annual
emigration from Italy is very heavy. In addition to the
true emigration, where there is a permanent change of
residence, there is a large amount of temporary or periodic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>migration, in which case the individual leaves his home
only for a short space of time, with the fixed intention of
returning. Much of this temporary emigration is directed
to France and Germany, where work is obtainable during
the summer season. Some of it turns toward North
America, and a large amount to South America. Many
Italians take advantage of the difference in seasons, and
put in two seasons of summer work in each year, one
on each side of the equator. It is estimated that about
one third of the total migration from Italy is of this
temporary or periodic character.<a id='r118'></a><a href='#f118' class='c018'><sup>[118]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Of the total number of immigrants to the United States
from Russia, somewhat less than one tenth are Russians.
The balance are Poles, Lithuanians, Finns, Germans,
and Jews. Agricultural, social, and political conditions
in Russia are sufficiently well understood to make it no
cause for wonder that almost any of its common citizens
should be glad to leave. The Russian peasant is said
to be the most oppressed in Europe, but he is also probably
the most ignorant and degraded, and as yet is only
beginning to learn to emigrate. There is a great reservoir
there which will be ready to furnish us untold
millions when the current gets well started. But so far
the great stream from Russia is made up principally of
other races. Of these, we are particularly interested in
the Jews, partly because they are the most numerous,
partly because they are a unique and striking people,
partly because the reasons for their coming are more
definite and easily comprehended.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have seen that during the Middle Ages the Jews
were expelled from almost every country of Europe.
Almost the only region where they were allowed a settlement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>was in Poland, and hence they gathered there in
large numbers. Under Russian domination this has
been made the “Pale of Settlement” for the Jews, and
now contains about one third of the 11,000,000 people
of that race in the world. Life in any other part of the
Empire is made practically impossible for them, and it is
far from easy there. Among the other restrictions put
upon the Jews during the Middle Ages was a prohibition
of engaging in agriculture. But they were allowed to
take usury, which was forbidden to Christians. The
natural result was that they were driven almost entirely
into trade, and particularly into money lending, so that
those pursuits which seem to be so well adapted to the
natural proclivities of the Jews were in a sense thrust
upon them. As a result the Jews in Russia are engaged
primarily in the two businesses of lending money and
selling liquor. When the Russian serfs were liberated
in 1861, and left in a most helpless state without either
capital or land, the Jews became their merchants,
middlemen, and usurers. It was perfectly natural that
the ignorant peasant should come to blame the money
lender and the saloon keeper for evils which were really
due to the wretched political, social, and economic
organization, but of which they seemed to be the immediate
agents. There is reason to believe that the
government encouraged this popular antipathy toward
an unpopular race for the sake of diverting the indignation
of the masses from itself. Certain it is that the
attitude of the government has been most hostile to the
Jews. In 1881 this antagonism culminated in a series of
terrible anti-Semitic riots, and then began the exodus to
America.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the next year, 1882, were passed a set of laws, known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>as the May Laws, which, with other subsequent ones of a
similar nature, have made existence for the Jews almost
intolerable in the Russian Empire. These laws, inspired
largely by the Greek Orthodox Church, have made it
impossible for the Jew “to foreclose a mortgage or to
lease or purchase land; he cannot do business on Sundays
or Christian holidays; he cannot hold office; he
cannot worship or assemble without police permit; he
must serve in the army, but cannot become an officer;
he is excluded from schools and universities; he is fined
for conducting manufactures and commerce; he is almost
prohibited from the learned professions.”<a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c018'><sup>[119]</sup></a> The press
is against them. Here in America we hear of only the
climaxes of this persecution, but the oppression is constant
and untiring. Is it any wonder that the Jews seek
relief in flight?</p>

<p class='c010'>It will become evident from time to time that our
Jewish immigration is in many respects unique, and
stands as an exception to many of the general principles
which one might lay down concerning immigration.
So in respect to the causes of their emigration it is not
surprising to find a situation somewhat different from
other branches of the new immigration, or from any
other immigration, in fact. The Jews have always been
a “peculiar people,” and religion has played a larger
part in their history than in the case of probably any
other modern people. The persecutions to which they
have been subjected from age to age have had religious
diversity as their ostensible and obvious, if not always
their only, motive. And in the modern emigration from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Russia, while the oppression under which they suffer
touches almost every phase of their life, and imposes
numberless economic handicaps, it rests ultimately upon
religious grounds. Russia is the only modern country
from which numerous emigrants are driven by actual
persecution, though it is said that Roumania has
within the last ten years passed anti-Jewish laws more
stringent than those of Russia.</p>

<p class='c010'>Conditions in Austria-Hungary and Italy, and to a less
extent in Russia, may be taken as typical of the circumstances
which prevail in other countries of southern
and eastern Europe, and Asia Minor, from which our
new immigrants come. In Bulgaria the following four
particular reasons have been assigned for emigration:</p>

<p class='c010'>(1) Bulgaria is distinctively an agricultural country,
and while a large per cent of the people own their farms,
the holdings are too small to enable them to make a
sufficient living, and the methods of cultivation are poor.</p>

<p class='c010'>(2) There is a great dearth of manufacturing industry.
In 1907 there were only 166 factories of any size, with
6149 workers.</p>

<p class='c010'>(3) Taxes are very heavy, amounting to one fifth, one
fourth, or even one third of the earnings of families.</p>

<p class='c010'>(4) There is much dissatisfaction with the government
among the peasants on the grounds of expense, and of
the very oppressive terms of military service.<a id='r120'></a><a href='#f120' class='c018'><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Summing up the facts regarding the volume and racial
character of immigration during this period, it appears
that, as regards the former, the series of waves has been
continued, responding to the economic conditions, but
reaching a much higher culmination than ever before.
As regards the latter, there has been a most distinct and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>profound change. The main source of the immigrant
current has shifted away from northern and western
Europe, to the southern and eastern portions of the continent,
whose people are by no means so closely related in
physique or so similar in mental characteristics to the
people of the United States as the immigrants of earlier
periods. The causes of this change lie primarily in
altered conditions in the United States which make it
less attractive to the residents of the more advanced
nations of Europe than formerly. In the more backward
countries the political and economic situation is
still so inferior to the United States that an ample
motive for emigration exists. All that was needed to
start a large movement was a knowledge of the possibilities
across the Atlantic, and the means of getting there.
Both of these have been provided within the period in
question.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VIII<br> <span class='c017'>THE CAUSES OF IMMIGRATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There are two things which the student of sociological
problems—like every other scientist—wishes to know
about the phenomena which fall within his field. These
are the causes and the effects. Hitherto we have said a
good deal about the causes of immigration and very
little about the effects. In truth, it is much simpler to
predicate causes of such a movement than effects. The
causes lie in the past; the effects are largely a matter of
the future. It is possible to state with a fair degree of
certainty what are the causes of the modern immigration
to the United States. The reader will have already
formed a general idea from the examples of the new
immigration which we have given.</p>

<p class='c010'>In general the causes of our recent and present immigration
may be divided into two classes, the natural and
the artificial. Most of what has been said thus far refers
to the former; the latter has been merely hinted at.
Another distinction which is often helpful is that between
the permanent or predisposing causes, and the temporary
or immediate causes. It frequently happens that in a
given country there are conditions of long standing—perhaps
inherent in the character of the country itself—which
make life hard and disagreeable for the resident.
Yet no immigration takes place until some relatively
trivial event, of a temporary nature, occurs, which serves
as the final impulse to emigration. To the superficial
view this temporary event appears as the cause of emigration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>when in point of fact its weight in the total amount
of dissatisfactions is insignificant.<a id='r121'></a><a href='#f121' class='c018'><sup>[121]</sup></a> The natural causes
of immigration at the present time lie primarily in the
superiority of the economic conditions in the United
States over those in the countries from which the immigrants
come. Modern immigration is essentially an
economic phenomenon. Religious and political causes
have played the leading part in the past, and still enter
in as contributory factors in many cases. But the one
prevailing reason why the immigrant of to-day leaves
his native village is that he is dissatisfied with his economic
lot, as compared with what it might be in the new
world. The European peasant comes to America because
he can—or believes he can—secure a greater
return in material welfare for the amount of labor
expended in this country than in his home land. This
fact is recognized by practically all careful students of
the subject, and is frequently emphasized in the recent
report of the Immigration Commission. It is worthy
of notice, also, that the changes which affect the volume
of the immigration current, and cause those repeated
fluctuations which we have observed, are changes in the
economic situation in this country, rather than in the
countries of source. A period of good times in this
country attracts large numbers of immigrants by promising
large rewards for labor; an industrial depression
checks the incoming current, and sends away many of
those who are here. This is probably accounted for
by the fact that economic conditions in this country
are subject to greater oscillations than in European
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>countries which are relatively static, rather than dynamic.
An example of the opposite condition is furnished by
the Irish emigration of the middle of the nineteenth
century, when a great economic disaster in the country
of source occasioned a large increase in emigration.
This relation between the economic situation in this
country and the volume of immigration has been worked
out statistically by Professor Commons, and is presented
in graphic form in a table in his book, <cite>Races and Immigrants
in America</cite> (opposite page 64). In this table
he takes imports as an index of the prosperity of the
United States and shows how closely the curve representing
immigration follows the curve of imports per
capita. If he could have taken account of the departing
aliens as well, the showing would probably have been
still more striking.</p>

<p class='c010'>The search for the reasons for this economic superiority
of the United States involves an investigation too
complicated and extensive to be undertaken in the present
connection. There are two factors, however, which
may be pointed out, which, at the beginning of our
national life, gave us an advantage possessed by no other
modern nation. The first of these was the small ratio
between men and land, which we have commented on
before. The territory of the United States was a vast,
newly discovered region, with untold natural resources
and every advantage of climate and configuration, inhabited
by a mere handful of settlers, at a time when the
nations of Europe had long since struck a balance between
population and land, on the customary standard
of living. The countries of Europe have also profited,
it is true, by the opening up of this great new world.
But their benefit has been transmitted and indirect,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>while the American people have been the direct and immediate
recipients of this great advantage. The importance
of this factor can hardly be overestimated.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second of these great factors is the character of
the American people themselves. We have seen that
this was well formed and distinctive at the time of the
Revolution. The early settlers of the North American
continent were in many respects a picked body, taken
from the best of the populations of Europe. Their
descendants were also subjected to the stern selective
processes of the struggle with, and conquest of, the
wilderness, and the establishment of their own economic
and political independence. As a result, the American
people at the beginning of our national life had certain
qualities both of physical and intellectual character,—hardihood,
enterprise, daring, independence, love of
freedom, perseverance, etc.,—which set them apart
from any of their contemporaries.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has been the combination of these two factors—a
unique people in a rich virgin land—which, more than
anything else, has accounted for the eminent position
attained by the American nation in the economic life
of the world. Many other circumstances have doubtless
contributed to the result, but they would have been
powerless to accomplish the end, without these two
essential prerequisites. With the disappearance of these
two distinguishing features the United States will begin
to lose her position of economic superiority.</p>

<p class='c010'>The statement made in a previous paragraph, that the
immigrant comes to America because he can—or believes
he can—better his economic lot by so doing, suggested
that great class of causes which we have called the
artificial. The advantages of the economic life in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>United States all too frequently exist, not in fact, but
in the mind of the prospective emigrant. And this belief
is equally potent in stirring up emigration, whether
it is grounded on fact or not. There are hosts of immigrants
passing through the portals of Ellis Island
every year whose venture is based on a sad misconception.
There are also countless numbers who would never
have engaged in the undertaking had not the idea of
doing so been forcibly and persistently instilled into
their minds by some outside agency. In other words,
a very large part of our present immigration is not
spontaneous and due to natural causes, but is artificial
and stimulated. This stimulation consists in creating
the desire and determination to migrate, by inducing
dissatisfaction with existing conditions as compared
with what the new world has to offer. Its source is in
some interested person or agency whose motive may, or
may not, be selfish.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are three principal sources from which this
stimulation or encouragement to immigration emanates—the
transportation companies, the labor agents,
and the previous immigrants. The motive of the first
two is an economic and wholly selfish one; that of the
latter may or may not be selfish.</p>

<p class='c010'>The carrying of immigrants from Europe to America
is a very vast and lucrative business. The customary
charge for steerage passage averages at least $30, and
as the large immigrant ships carry 2000 or more steerage
passengers there is a possibility of receiving as
much as $60,000 from steerage passengers on a single
voyage. It is, furthermore, a business which can be
almost indefinitely expanded by vigorous pushing. A
skillful agent can induce almost any number of the simple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>and credulous peasants of a backward European country
to emigrate, who had scarcely had such an idea in their
heads before. Consequently it pays the transportation
companies to have an immense army of such agents,
continually working over the field, and opening up new
territory. The motive is not so much rivalry for a given
amount of business between the different companies; a
mutual agreement between different lines or groups of
lines, dividing up the territory from which they shall
draw their steerage passengers, practically precludes
this.<a id='r122'></a><a href='#f122' class='c018'><sup>[122]</sup></a> It is rather the possibility of actually creating new
business by energetic canvassing.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is obvious that the activity of these agents may be of
the most pernicious nature. The welfare of the immigrant,
or the benefit of either country concerned, are of
no concern to them. Their sole aim is to get business.
So long as the immigrant has the wherewithal to pay
his passage, it matters not to them where he got it, nor
are they deterred by any doubts as to the fitness of the
immigrant for American life, or of the probability of his
success there. In fact, it is claimed that the steamship
companies prefer a class of immigrants which is likely,
eventually, to return to the old country, as this creates
a traffic going the other way. The only checks to their
operations are such as are imposed by their own scruples,
and the possession of too many of these does not help a
man to qualify for the position of agent.</p>

<p class='c010'>The methods used by these agents to encourage
emigration are most ingenious and insidious. Every
possible means is used to make the peasant dissatisfied
with his present lot, and to impress him with the glories
and joys of life in America. Many, perhaps the majority,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>of the agents are themselves returned immigrants, who
give glittering accounts of their experiences in America,
and display gold watches, diamond pins, and various
other proofs of their prosperity. The methods of to-day
are not quite so crude and bizarre as they used to be.
The stories of the richness of America and the ease of life
there which used to be current were so overdrawn as to
undeceive any but the most ignorant and gullible.
Immigrants have left for America expecting to be able
to pick up unlimited dollars lying loose in the streets, and
stories are told of steerage passengers who threw away
the cooking utensils they had brought with them, as the
vessel neared New York, supposing that they could get
a new lot for nothing as soon as they landed. A better
knowledge of actual conditions in America, which now
prevails in most European countries, has precluded the
continued circulation of such fictions as these. In fact,
if there were not real advantages in the United States,
and many cases of successful emigrants, the agents
would not be able to operate successfully for an indefinite
time. But as yet there does exist a sufficient difference
between conditions in the new world and in the old to give
them a basis of truth, which they may embellish as occasion
demands. Many of these agents make a practice of
advancing money to the emigrants to pay for their passage,
taking a mortgage on their property for an amount
far in advance of that actually furnished. These debts
are met with a strange faithfulness by the immigrants,
even when they have been woefully deceived and cheated.
In Greece it is asserted that the agents work through
the priests, and thus largely increase their influence.<a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c018'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Immigration which is inspired by such stimulation as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>this is far from being so desirable as that which is natural
and spontaneous. It follows no natural laws, and responds
to no economic demand in this country. It is
likely to be of injury rather than of benefit to the United
States, and works untold injustice to the immigrants.
It is regarded as pernicious by all fair-minded observers,
and the United States government has made serious
efforts to check it. This is the purpose of the clause
in the immigration law limiting the nature of solicitation
that may be done by transportation lines. The solicitation
of immigration is no new thing. Hale, in his <cite>Letters
on Irish Immigration</cite>, written in 1851–1852, said that competition
between the different lines of packets and different
shipping houses had made the means of emigration
familiar in the remotest corners of Ireland, and that
advertising was fully utilized. Professor Mayo-Smith
in 1892 wrote that the Inman Steamship Company had
3500 agents in Europe and an equal number in the
United States selling prepaid tickets. In Switzerland
in 1885 there were 400 licensed emigration agents.<a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c018'><sup>[124]</sup></a>
The laws passed since then have forced the agents to
proceed more cautiously, and conceal their activities.
They have not put a stop to their operations.</p>

<p class='c010'>These emigration agents are by no means all accredited
representatives of the steamship lines over which they
send their recruits. There are, to be sure, plenty of
official agents of the various transportation companies,
who are openly acknowledged as such. The region
around the harbor, in many of the Mediterranean seaports,
is thronged with steamship ticket offices, often
flying the American flag, and with emigration agencies,
and the line between the two is frequently very difficult
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>to draw. But the traveling agents, or “runners,” are
often free lances as far as appearances go. It is very
hard to establish any connection between them and any
transportation company. Yet all who have investigated
the subject are convinced that there is a close understanding
and coöperation between the two, even if
there is no official relation. It is contrary to human
nature, when so much money is to be made by such canvassing,
and there are plenty of people ready to do it,
that the transportation companies should neglect the
opportunity. On this subject the Immigration Commission
says, “It does not appear that the steamship
lines as a rule openly direct the operations of these agents,
but the existence of the propaganda is a matter of
common knowledge in the emigrant-furnishing countries,
and, it is fair to assume, is acquiesced in, if not stimulated,
by the steamship lines as well.”<a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c018'><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The Commissioner General of Immigration is much
more emphatic in his statements. The report for 1909
contains the following passages (p. 112): “The promoter
is usually a steamship ticket agent, employed on a commission
basis, or a professional money lender, or a
combination of the two.... He is employed by the
steamship lines, large and small, without scruple, and to
the enormous profit of such lines.... To say that the
steamship lines are responsible, directly or indirectly, for
this unnatural immigration is not the statement of a
theory, but of a fact, and of a fact that sometimes becomes,
indeed, if it is not always, a crying shame....
[Referring to Contract Labor Inspector John Gruenberg]
He shows quite clearly that all of the steamship lines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>engaged in bringing aliens from Europe to this country
have persistently and systematically violated the law,
both in its letter and spirit, by making use of every
possible means to encourage the peasants of Europe to
purchase tickets over their lines to this country. They
have issued circulars and advertisements, and made use
of extensive correspondence, through their own agents in
this country and in Europe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The law referred to is Section 7 of the Act of 1907, repeating
in substance Section 4, Act of 1891 (p. 111). The
ease and persistency with which this provision, carefully
worded as it is, is violated, furnishes a striking example
of the difficulty of passing statutes which shall be capable
of enforcement, especially in foreign countries, to put a
stop to practices which are universally conceded to be
undesirable.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second great source of stimulation to emigration
is the labor agent. His operations are extensive and
diversified, and always in direct violation of the contract
labor law. That section of the immigration statutes,
as previously pointed out, is so sweepingly drawn as to
make any immigrant, not in the excepted classes, who has
received the slightest intimation that there is work awaiting
him in this country, a violator of the law. But the
economic advantage to employers in this country of importing
European labor under contract to perform
services in the United States at much less than the market
rate of wages, is so great, that, as in the previous case,
human nature cannot resist the temptation, provided
the chances of escaping detection are sufficiently good.
And this part of the law, like that relating to advertising,
is of such a nature as to make it susceptible of continued
and extensive evasion by unscrupulous persons, possessed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>of such skill and craftiness as characterize the
typical contract labor agent. While there is no way of
estimating the extent of this practice, there is no doubt
that only a very small proportion of the present immigration,
from the Mediterranean countries at least, is innocent
of the letter of the law, strictly interpreted. This
is not to say that they are under actual contract to labor,
but that their coming has been encouraged by some sort
of intimation that there would be work awaiting them.</p>

<p class='c010'>By a recent opinion of the Attorney-General, two
essential points have been laid down in the construction
of the contract labor laws, as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“(1) That they ‘prohibit any offer or promise of
employment which is of such a definite character that an
acceptance thereof would constitute a contract.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“(2) That the prohibition to encourage the immigration
of an alien by a promise of employment is ‘directed
against a promise which specially designates the particular
job or work or employment for which the alien’s
labor is desired.’”<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c018'><sup>[126]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Even under this somewhat liberal interpretation of the
laws, wholesale violations undoubtedly go on. In the
words of the Immigration Commission, “In this way
hundreds of immigrants are annually debarred at United
States ports as contract laborers, while doubtless hundreds
of thousands more are admitted who have practically
definite assurances as to the place and nature of
their employment in this country.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A fuller description of contract labor in general, and
of that particular form of it which is known as the padrone
system, will be given in another connection. The
point to be emphasized here is that it operates as one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>the great causes of our present immigration, and that it
continues to exert a powerful, and probably increasing,
influence, in spite of all the efforts of the legislators and
officials of the United States to check it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The third source of stimulation to emigration is the
earlier immigrant himself. He is probably the greatest
factor of all in induced immigration, and his influence is
utilized in various ways by both emigration agents and
labor agents, and made to contribute to the success of
their efforts.</p>

<p class='c010'>Every stream of immigration must have its origin
in some few individuals, who, the first of their region,
break the ties of home and fatherland, and go to seek their
fortune in a new and far-away land. Upon their success
depends the question whether others from the same district
shall follow in their footsteps. If they fail in their
venture, it serves as a discouraging factor as respects
further emigration from that region. But if they succeed,
and win a position which makes them envied in the
eyes of their fellow-countrymen, it furnishes a powerful
stimulus to further emigration. Sooner or later, there
will be some who succeed from every region, and the example
of a few successful ones is likely to far outweigh
numerous failures. Something like this is going on in
countless remote districts of the south European countries,
and has gone on for decades in every country
which has sent us numbers of immigrants.</p>

<p class='c010'>Take a typical example. Some Slav peasant, in a little
village of Austria-Hungary, of a more ambitious and
adventurous disposition than most of his fellows, hears
of the opportunities in America, and being dissatisfied
with his present lot, decides to try his fortune in the new
world. His first “job” is in a mine in some small town
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>of Pennsylvania. Accustomed as he is to a low standard
of living, he is able to save a considerable part of the
wages which seem munificent to him. From time to
time he writes letters home, telling of his prosperity.
Eventually he saves up enough to purchase a little store
or saloon. Of course there will be a letter telling about
that. These letters are wonderful documents in the
eyes of his friends and relatives at home. Correspondence
does not flourish in these regions, and the receipt
of any letter is a matter of great importance. The arrival
of a message from across the sea creates an impression
which it is almost impossible for an American to
comprehend. The precious missive is read aloud in the
coffee-houses, and passed from hand to hand throughout
the village. It may even travel to neighboring hamlets,
and make its impression there. The neighbor in America,
and his career, become the foremost topic of conversation
for miles around.</p>

<p class='c010'>In time all this has its effect. A small group of the
original emigrant’s former neighbors resolve to try their
luck too. The most natural thing, of course, is for them
to go to the place where their friend is. He helps them
to find work, tides them over difficulties, and in various
ways makes their life easier and simpler than his had
been. Each of these newcomers also writes letters home,
which go through the same round, and add to the growing
knowledge of America, and the discontent with
European life in comparison. Once started, the movement
grows with great rapidity, and the letters from
America increase in geometrical proportion. Other
nuclei start up in other places, recruits are drawn from
more distant villages, and the first little trickling stream
becomes a swelling tide.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>This is what has come to be known as the chain-letter
system. Multiplied by hundreds of thousands, the
foregoing example serves to illustrate the irresistible
network of communications which is drawing the peasants
of Europe to every part of the United States.
This is recognized by all authorities as probably the most
powerful single factor in stirring up emigration from
such countries as Italy, Austria-Hungary, Greece,
Bulgaria, etc. Its effect has been graphically described
by a Greek writer in the following words:</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Such a one, from such a village, sent home so many
dollars within a year,’ is heard in some village or city,
and this news, passed like lightning from village to village
and from city to city, and magnified from mouth to
mouth, causes the farmer to forsake his plow, the shepherd
to sell his sheep, the mechanic to throw away his
tools, the small-grocer to break up his store, the teacher
to forsake his rostrum, and all to hasten to provide
passage money, so that they may embark, if possible,
on the first ship for America, and gather up the dollars
in the streets before they are all gone.”<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c018'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>This is a perfectly natural influence, and obviously
beyond the power of any legislation to check, even if that
were desirable. When inspired merely by a friendly
interest in the home neighbors, a desire to keep in touch
with them, and a little personal vanity, it is probably the
most harmless of any of the forms of stimulation. When,
as all too frequently happens, the underlying motive is
sinister and selfish, it becomes a source of the greatest
deceit and injustice.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the pioneer emigrant returns to his native
village, after some years of prosperous life in America,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>his influence and importance are unbounded. He becomes
in truth the “observed of all observers.” Groups
of interested listeners and questioners gather round him
wherever he goes, and hang on his words in breathless
awe. His fine, strange clothes, his sparkling jewelry
and gold watch, his easy, worldly manners, all arouse
the greatest admiration. He has to tell over and over
again the story of his career, and describe the wonders
of that far-away land. If such a one is returning to the
United States, it takes no urging on his part to induce a
number of his countrymen to accompany him; they are
fairly clinging to the skirts of his garments, to be taken
back. Even if he has come home to remain, his constant
example is there to inspire the youth of the village to
follow in his path. So the “visit home” and the “returned
immigrant” add their weight to the influence of
the stream of letters. How universal this condition
has become is evidenced by the fact that in 1909 only
6.3 per cent of all the immigrants admitted to the United
States were not going to join either relatives or friends,
according to their statement; in 1910 the percentage
was only 4.9. In 1912 it rose to 7.5. About six times
as many go to join relatives as friends.</p>

<p class='c010'>Many of the letters from America contain remittances
from the immigrants to their friends and relatives at home.
Often these remittances take the form of prepaid tickets,<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c018'><sup>[128]</sup></a>
complete from some European center or port to the city
in America, where the sender is waiting. Then their
influence is absolutely irresistible. The transportation
companies make every effort to make the passage as
simple as possible, and railroad companies in this country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>make special immigrant rates, to be used in connection
with such tickets. A large part of the induced immigration
of the present day is also assisted immigration. It is
a perfectly natural thing that an immigrant in this country
should wish to be joined by certain of his relatives on
the other side, and, if he is able, should send them the
means to come. This has always been done. In the
middle of the nineteenth century E. E. Hale wrote that a
large part of the letters from Irish to their friends in this
country consisted in acknowledgments of remittances,
and requests for more. The remittances in 1850 are
said to have amounted to about four and one half million
dollars. Prepaid tickets were also in use at that date.
It is manifestly impossible to estimate correctly the
extent of this business at the present time. According
to the official reports, in 1910, 72.5 per cent of the immigrants
had paid for their own tickets, 26.5 per cent had
their tickets paid for by a relative, and 1 per cent by
some one other than self or relative. But this showing
rests solely upon the immigrant’s own statement, and is
undoubtedly an underestimate. The suspicion of immigrants
whose passage is paid for them, which characterizes
our law, leads many to practice deceit in this matter.
For instance, it is almost impossible to believe that all
but 5.4 per cent of the Greeks had paid their own passage.
An examination of the figures shows that there is a larger
proportion of passages paid by some one besides the immigrant
among the old immigration than among the new.
This is explained by the fact that the old immigration
has more of a family character, and that immigrants are
sending for wives and children. This can be understood
only by comparison with the sex and age tables.<a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c018'><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Even when these remittances are not in the form of
prepaid tickets, nor are even intended to pay passage
in any way, they exert a powerful influence in stirring up
immigration, through the tangible evidence which they
furnish of American possibilities. There could be no
stronger proof of the success of immigrants in the United
States than the constant stream of gold which is flowing
from this country to Europe.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the sake of clearness, these different forms of
stimulation have been discussed separately. In practice,
they overlap and combine in a variety of complicated
relations. The emigration agent is often himself a
returned immigrant; if not, he utilizes all the influences
which arise from the letters, visits, and remittances of
actual immigrants to further his ends. The letters from
America are often misleading or spurious, used by labor
agents in this country to entice others to come. The
prepaid ticket is susceptible of a wide variety of uses.
Assistance to emigrants is often furnished, not by well-disposed
friends and relatives, but by loan-sharks, whose
motives are wholly selfish, and whose sole aim is to secure
usurious rates of interest for sums advanced, which
are amply protected by mortgages.</p>

<p class='c010'>As a result of this complex of motives and forces,
America has become a household word even to the remote
corners of Europe, and he who wishes, for any reason, to
stir up emigration from any region finds a fertile field
already prepared for him. It is amazing to find how
much an ignorant Greek peasant knows about conditions
in America. The economic situation is, of course,
the prime interest. But there is also a good fund of information
about social and political subjects. There
are of course many misconceptions and errors, but it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>evident that the lines of communication between the
European village and the American city are very well
established. Similar conditions prevail in all the immigrant-furnishing
countries.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is impossible to say to just what extent our present
immigration ought to be classified as induced. It is
probable that only a very small part of the total immigration
is wholly free from stimulation to some degree.
Certain it is that a very large proportion of it is thoroughly
artificial and induced. The getting of immigrants is
now a thoroughly developed system, planned to serve the
needs of every form of interest which might profit thereby.<a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c018'><sup>[130]</sup></a>
As to the quality of such immigration, something
has already been said. There is evidently nothing
about the immigrants themselves, or the way in which
they are secured, that serves as a guarantee of their
serviceability or value to this country; as to their own
prospects, we can do no better in closing this chapter
than to quote the words of the Commissioner General;
these various operations “often result in placing upon
our shores large numbers of aliens who, if the facts were
only known at the time, are worse than destitute, are
burdened with obligations to which they and all their
relatives are parties,—debts secured with mortgages on
such small holdings as they and their relatives possess,
and on which usurious interest must be paid. Pitiable
indeed is their condition, and pitiable it must remain unless
good fortune accompanies the alien while he is struggling
to exist and is denying himself the necessaries of
decent living in order to clear himself of the incubus of
accumulated debt. If he secures and retains employment
at fair wages, escapes the wiles of that large class
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>of aliens living here who prey upon their ignorant compatriots,
and retains his health under often adverse
circumstances, all may terminate well for him and his;
if he does not, disaster is the result to him and them.”<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c018'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER IX<br> <span class='c017'>THE EFFECTS OF IMMIGRATION. CONDITIONS OF EMBARKATION AND TRANSPORTATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It was remarked in an earlier paragraph that the
effects of immigration were largely a matter of the future.
This may have seemed like too sweeping a statement.
Yet it will prove true upon consideration. In the case
of the old immigration there are, to be sure, certain immediate
and superficial effects which may be postulated
with a fair degree of certainty. As an example, we may
be reasonably sure that the old immigration has increased
the proportion of Irish, German, and Scandinavian blood
in the composite American people. But as to the ultimate
effects of this movement upon the social, religious,
moral, and economic aspects of our national life, we can,
at best, hazard only a forecast. The reason is that the
effects have not transpired as yet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One of the commonest errors of writers on sociological
topics is to allow too little time for the action of social
forces. We are inclined to think that the effects of a
certain social phenomenon, which we are able to detect
in our lifetime, are the permanent and final effects.
We forget that these matters may require many generations
to work themselves out. No better illustration of
this could be asked for than that furnished by the case
of the negroes in the United States. The importation of
these people began many generations ago. To our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>ancestors it undoubtedly seemed a perfectly natural
thing to do, and for centuries it did not occur to anybody
to even question its rightfulness or its expediency.
When objections began to be raised, they were feeble
and easily put aside. But at last the presence of this
peculiar class of people in the country involved the nation
in a terrible and bloody conflict, which worked irreparable
injury to the American stock by the annihilation of the
flower of southern manhood, and left us a problem which
is probably the greatest one before the American people
to-day—one which we have hardly begun to solve.
There is much of similarity between the case of the negroes
and that of the modern immigrants. To be sure, the
newcomers of to-day are for the most part white-skinned,
instead of colored, which gives a different aspect to the
matter. Yet in the mind of the average American, the
modern immigrants are generally regarded as inferior
peoples—races which he looks down on, and with which
he does not wish to associate on terms of social equality.
Like the negroes, they are brought in for economic reasons,
to do the hard and menial work to which an American
does not wish to stoop.”<a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c018'><sup>[132]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Even in the case of the old immigration, then, the
effects are largely in the future; in the case of the new
immigration they are almost wholly so. We have seen
that in regard to racial stock the new immigration has
been predominant for scarcely half a generation. There
are a number of circumstances besides this which make
the immigration problem practically a new one. Certain
of the most important factors which condition
it, and many of the aspects which it presents to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>public mind, are new to the men of this generation.
The verification of this statement is to be found in the
following pages; in the present connection it must suffice
merely to suggest the circumstances in which these
differences may be looked for. These may be grouped
under six main heads, as follows: (1) the racial stock of
the immigrants; (2) the volume of the immigration
current; (3) the distribution of immigrants in the
United States; (4) the economic conditions of this
country; (5) the native birth rate; (6) the quality of the
immigrants.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the effects of immigration are mainly in the future,
the discussion of them must be, for the most part,
theoretical. It is a discussion of something which is
going to happen, or which is likely to happen, not of
something that has happened. This gives it an element
of uncertainty and speculation which is not wholly
desirable in a scientific study. Yet this is the phase of
the subject which is by far the most interesting and important
to the average American citizen who wants to
know how this great sociological phenomenon is going to
affect him, and his country, and his relatives and friends.
His attitude toward the question will depend upon what
he believes these effects will be. If it appears to him
that immigration will benefit himself, his country, the
immigrants, or humanity in general, he will favor it; if
his belief is to the contrary, his attitude will be one of
opposition. Since there is no certainty as to what the
effects will be, the arguments about immigration are
largely composed of attempts to prove that certain
effects have transpired, or to demonstrate that they
will transpire. As a consequence, it comes about that
the discussion of the effects of immigration practically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>resolves itself into a consideration of the arguments
for and against immigration, and it will be so treated, for
the most part, in the following chapters.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are three classes of effects of immigration which
may be clearly distinguished, and which will interest
different persons in different degrees. These are the effects
upon the United States, the effects upon the countries
of source, and the effects upon the immigrants
themselves. The second and third of these interest the
American citizen only as he is open to broad humanitarian
considerations; the first touches him directly, and may
have an intimate bearing on his personal and selfish
interests and pursuits. If a seemingly disproportionate
space is given in this volume to effects in general, and
effects upon the United States in particular, it is because
this is the vital and imperative part of the whole subject
to the people of this nation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Although the effects of immigration are largely a
matter of speculation and debate, one step may be taken
which will help to make the deductions arrived at as
reliable as is possible under the circumstances. This is
a careful investigation of the actual conditions which
surround immigration at the present time, and a comparison
of them with those of the past. Only upon a
solid basis of such facts can any trustworthy predictions
be made as to what may be expected to come about in
the future. Accordingly, in preparation for the discussion
of effects, we will attempt to get a clear picture
of the circumstances which surround the immigrant on
his journey from the old world to the new; of his condition
when he arrives; of the character of his life and
labor in his new home. In general, the plan followed
will be to take up each set of conditions in turn, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>having ascertained the facts, to try to determine what
bearing these seem likely to have upon the final effects
of immigration. This will at times involve a departure
from the strictly logical method of treatment, but this is
unavoidable in such a complicated discussion.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the sources of our present immigration we are
already familiar. We have seen how they have shifted
from the north and west of Europe to the south and east.
It has been stated that the movement is essentially a
European one. This is still emphatically true. In
1912, 85.8 per cent of all our immigrants came from
Europe, and if we exclude Turkey in Asia (which really
is a part of Europe in the ethnical sense), British North
America, Mexico, and the West Indies, there is very little
left of the non-European portion. So it is still correct,
for all important purposes, to regard immigration to the
United States as having its origin in Europe. How
long this will continue, it is of course impossible to say.
There are vast reservoirs of population in Asia, to say
nothing of the other continents, which we have scarcely
as yet tapped, and which may reach the point of emigration
with advancing civilization. Whether or not we are
to receive large contingents from these countries in the
future will depend largely upon the attitude of our
government. So far, we have put up the bars before
the Chinese, and unless they are lowered, which hardly
seems likely, we need not anticipate any considerable
number of arrivals of this race. Up to 1900 there were
only a comparatively few Japanese in this country.
Since then, the rising tide of immigration from Japan,
which threatened to reach large proportions, has been
checked, partly by “a series of measures which permits
the greater part of the administrative problem to rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>with the Japanese government,”<a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c018'><sup>[133]</sup></a> which is avowedly
opposed to the emigration of its laboring population,
and partly by a presidential order from the White House
on March 14, 1907,<a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c018'><sup>[134]</sup></a> denying admission to Japanese and
Korean laborers, who had received passports to go to
Canada, Mexico, or Hawaii, and were using them to
secure admittance to continental United States. While
the new treaty between this country and Japan contains
no specific prohibition of immigration, it is understood
that the Japanese government agrees to prevent the
emigration of laborers from that country to this. A new
problem has recently appeared in the Pacific coast states
in the form of an East Indian immigration. The manifestly
undesirable character of this immigration, however,
has led the immigration officials in the Pacific seaports
to apply the law to members of this race with the greatest
strictness, so that most, if not all, of the Hindu laborers
applying for admission have been debarred on the
grounds of belief in polygamy, liability to become a public
charge, or some other provision of the statutes. A
similar attitude on the part of the Canadian immigration
officials has been of assistance in stopping at the outset
what might have grown into a very important current
of immigration.<a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c018'><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Whatever the future may bring forth, then, our immigration
at present springs from European sources.<a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c018'><sup>[136]</sup></a>
Every country on the continent furnishes its contingent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>large or small. From the cities, towns, and villages,
most of all from the rural sections, even to the most
remote corners of the back districts, they come, inspired
with great hopes by the emigration agents and the labor
contractors, aided by friends or relatives or future employers
on the other side. Homes and property are
mortgaged, the labor of their bodies—even their very
souls—are pledged, to pay their passage. Wives,
children, and sweethearts are left behind. On foot, on
donkey back, in rude carriages and wagons, they travel
till the nearest railroad station is reached. The way is
made as easy as possible for them, through the agency
of interested parties, who profit by their coming. The
prepaid ticket avoids much confusion and perplexity.
Friends are awaiting them on the other side. In every
large group there are almost certain to be some who have
been over the road before. All the emigrant needs to do
is to allow himself to be passed along submissively from
one stage to another—provided he has the money to
pay. For those who make the way easy must have an
ample recompense.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the seacoast and the port of embarkation draw
near, the groups of emigrants increase in size by constant
additions. In the important emigration ports they arrive
by thousands during the busy season. The provisions
for their entertainment, while awaiting the sailing of
the vessel upon which they are to embark, differ in
different ports. In many ports they are required to
put up in the cheap hotels and lodging houses, which,
in such cases, abound in the neighborhood of the harbor.
In other ports, the steamship companies maintain extensive
emigrant stations, where emigrants are lodged
and cared for while awaiting transportation. Probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>the most elaborate of these is the emigrant village of the
Hamburg-American Line, at Hamburg. This is located
on the left bank of the Elbe, completely segregated from
the city, and is designed to receive only immigrants from
countries where the standard of health is low. It consists
of about twenty-five buildings, and accommodates
5000 persons. Among the buildings are a large inspection
building, a simple hotel, and a number of living
pavilions, each consisting of a dormitory, living room,
baths, etc. There is one large dining hall, with a special
section for Jews, for whom also a separate kitchen is
provided. The religious needs of the emigrants are
provided for by a synagogue, a Catholic church, and a
Protestant church.<a id='r137'></a><a href='#f137' class='c018'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The provision of the United States law, which requires
an examination and medical inspection at the port of
embarkation, is observed with different degrees of care in
different countries and by different lines. It is to the
advantage of the steamship company to refuse transportation
to any individuals who are manifestly inadmissible
to the United States, as their refusal involves
their return at the expense of the company, and in many
instances an additional fine of $100. On the other hand,
if there is a fair chance that the immigrant may succeed
in passing the examination, there is a strong temptation
for the steamship company to take him, for the sake of
his passage money. There is a practice, believed to be
quite extensive, among the transportation companies,
of compelling an alien who seems in danger of being
debarred, to deposit with the foreign agent from whom he
purchases his ticket a sum sufficient to cover the cost of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>his return in case he is refused admission. This is in
direct violation of the United States law, but the difficulty
of securing evidence has prevented the authorities
from putting an effective stop to the practice.<a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c018'><sup>[138]</sup></a> Large
numbers of would-be emigrants are nevertheless turned
back before embarkation, as a result of the examination
by the steamship company. The proportion of those
detained in this manner to those debarred at the ports
of arrival in the United States is at least four to one.<a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c018'><sup>[139]</sup></a>
Some companies have had such a bitter experience in the
matter of having their passengers refused as to lead them
to exercise great caution. The Austro-American Company,
which carries a large share of the Greek traffic,
had over 300 emigrants refused at the United States
port on one of their early voyages, and returned to
Europe. Since then, they have adopted the system of
having physicians provided for their forty subagencies in
various parts of Greece, who inspect applicants for tickets,
and pass upon them before any document is issued to
them by the agent. If this physician accepts an emigrant,
he is given a medical certificate, makes a deposit
toward his ticket, and has space reserved for him on the
steamer. He is then sent on to the port of embarkation,
where the final examination takes place.<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c018'><sup>[140]</sup></a> In this way
large numbers of inadmissible immigrants are kept from
leaving their native village, and are spared the expense
and disappointment of the trip to the port of
embarkation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The examination at the port of embarkation is differently
conducted at different seaports. As a rule the
medical examination is made by a physician employed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>by the steamship company, either the ship’s doctor, or a
specially engaged physician. But at some ports the
American consul chooses the physician, though the
steamship company pays him. At Naples, Palermo, and
Messina, by a special arrangement between the two
governments, the examination is made by officers of
the United States Public Health and Marine Hospital
Service, who examine steerage passengers and recommend
the rejection of those who are likely to be refused
admission to the United States. Their action is unofficial,
but their suggestions are always complied with.
Under the quarantine law of the United States the American
consular officers are also required to satisfy themselves
of the sanitary condition of passengers and ships
sailing for United States ports. In addition to the
medical examination, a long list of questions is put to
the immigrant, in accordance with the requirements of
the United States law. His answers are recorded on the
manifest, which is later put into the hands of the inspecting
officer at the port of arrival, who repeats the
same questions and notes whether the answers tally.
Vaccination and the disinfection of the passenger’s
baggage are important parts of the preparation of
emigrants for the journey to America. The differing degree
of care exercised in this examination at the different
ports is indicated by the fact that the proportion
of immigrants refused at the port of arrival for medical
causes, to the total number embarked from the different
ports, varies from 1 to 163 at the Piræus and 1 to
165 at Bremen, to 1 to 565 at Antwerp and 1 to 597
at Fiume.</p>

<p class='c010'>A large amount of transatlantic traffic passes through
Germany from neighboring states, and to protect herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>against having large numbers of foreign emigrants
refused at her ports, and left in a destitute and helpless
condition in her territory, Germany has compelled the
steamship companies to establish control-stations on the
German-Russian and German-Austrian borders. There
are fourteen of these stations, thirteen on the frontier,
and one near Berlin. All emigrants from eastern Europe
who are intending to pass through German territory to
ports of embarkation are examined at these stations, and
those who do not comply with the German law, or who
are evidently inadmissible to the United States, are
turned back. This is a wise and humane provision, for
the condition of the emigrant, who, having spent his all
to pay his passage to America, and traveled a long distance
to the seaboard, finds himself refused at the port
of embarkation, is often pitiable in the extreme.<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c018'><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The governments of most European countries do not
regard a large emigration with favor, partly because of
the withdrawal of men from military service, partly because
of the economic loss resulting from the departure
of so large a part of the laboring class. Most of them
exercise some control over emigration, and, in particular,
endeavor to combat the activities of the emigration
agents, which, however, they are as powerless to check as
is the United States. Nevertheless, there is practically
no effort to prohibit emigration altogether, as it is recognized
as a natural and irresistible movement. Italy
exercises the greatest care for the welfare of her immigrants
of any European nation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Practically all of the immigrants who are crossing for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>the first time, and probably a majority of those who have
made the trip before, travel in the steerage. The second
cabin is patronized by the more prosperous of the immigrants
who have been in the United States previously,
and by others who know themselves to be inadmissible,
and hope in this way to avoid a searching inspection.
The great bulk of the emigrants, however, having passed
their preliminary examination, flock up the steerage
gangway into the ship which is to convey them to
America. At the top of the ladder stands a ship’s officer
who examines their tickets and their certificates of
vaccination (sometimes a little purple mark stamped
on the wrist), and in certain cases searches them for concealed
weapons. They are then allowed to proceed to
the interior of the ship, and find their way to such berths
as suit their fancy, and are not already occupied, within
the limits of the section of the ship assigned to them.
Steerages are usually divided into three compartments,
more or less completely separated from each other;
one is for men without wives, another for women traveling
alone, and the third for families.</p>

<p class='c010'>Steerages on the transatlantic vessels are divided
into two main classes, designated by the Immigration
Commission as the old-type or old steerage, and the new-type
or new steerage. The former class predominates
on the Mediterranean lines; the latter is found on some
of the better ships of the north Atlantic service. Some
ships are equipped with both kinds. The old-type
steerage is still the typical one, and is found on the majority
of vessels bringing immigrants to the United States.
It is in such a steerage that the average immigrant gets
his first introduction to America—for everything after
he leaves the port of embarkation is closely identified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>with America in his mind. It is in this type of steerage
that the student of immigration is primarily interested.</p>

<p class='c010'>Steerages of this type all bear a general resemblance
to each other, and once seen can never be forgotten.
Imagine a large room, perhaps seven feet in height, extending
the entire breadth of the ship, and about one
third of its length. The floor and ceiling are sometimes
of iron, but more often of wood. Through the
center of the room, very probably, descends the shaft
to the hold. This room is filled with a framework of
iron pipes, with only sufficient space left to serve as
aisles or passageways. This framework is so constructed
as to form a series of berths or bunks, adjoining
each other laterally, and in two tiers vertically. The
dimensions of these berths are usually about six feet by
two, with approximately two and one half feet between
berths, and about the same space between the lower
berth and the deck below, and the upper berth and the
deck above. In each berth a network of strap iron
serves for the support of a coarse mattress, upon which
a pillow and a cheap blanket are the only bedding.
Often a life-preserver takes the place of the pillow.
Thus the room is filled with a double layer of beds, with
only space enough between for the passengers to reach
them. On some of the older ships wooden bunks may
still be found. Such a room will sometimes accommodate
as many as three hundred passengers, and is
duplicated in other parts of the ship, and on the successive
decks upon which immigrants are carried.</p>

<p class='c010'>In their provisions for steerage passengers most transportation
lines aim to trim as close to the minimum
requirements of the law as possible. The immigrant-carrying
business is a purely money-making enterprise,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>and humanitarian considerations have no place in it.
The good effects which might result from free competition
are practically eliminated by the recent agreement
dividing territory, which has been mentioned above.<a id='r142'></a><a href='#f142' class='c018'><sup>[142]</sup></a>
There is no other force to compel transportation companies
to go one whit beyond the legal requirements in
an effort to make their steerage passengers comfortable.</p>

<p class='c010'>The open deck space reserved for steerage passengers
is usually very limited, and situated in the worst part
of the ship, subject to the most violent motion, to the
dirt from the stacks and the odors from the hold and
galleys. The only provisions for eating are frequently
shelves or benches along the sides or in the passageways
of sleeping compartments. Some ships have separate
rooms, used for dining and recreation purposes, but these
are usually wholly inadequate to accommodate all the
steerage passengers. Frequently, too, they are planned
without the least regard to cleanliness, as when the
dining table, upon which the dishes remain set, is placed
directly below an open grating, through which the filth
and dirt may fall from the shoes of passers-by. Toilet
rooms are wholly inadequate in number, are poorly
designed, and often wholly uncared for during most of
the voyage. The resulting conditions are almost unbelievable.
Toilets are sometimes placed directly alongside
the only passages leading to the steerage quarters,
so that one must pass them, and breathe their horrible
stench, every time he passes in or out. The law requires
separate wash rooms for men and women, but
this is a distinction which is frequently ignored, men
and women using the same rooms promiscuously. The
provisions for washing are wholly inadequate. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>are only a few taps, and usually the only water provided
is cold salt water, which must be used for all purposes,
including the washing of dishes. The law requires that
hospitals for steerage passengers be provided, but as they
are not open to seasick passengers, they fail of their
greatest usefulness.</p>

<p class='c010'>The arrangements for feeding steerage passengers differ
on different vessels, but there are two main systems.
In the first, each passenger is furnished a cheap set of
eating utensils at the beginning of the voyage, which
remain in his possession till the close, and sometimes
permanently. At meal time the passengers form in
line, and pass before stewards who have large kettles of
food, and serve out the rations to each. Passengers may
eat at tables if there are any and they can find places;
otherwise, wherever they can. After the meal, they
must wash their own dishes, and stow them away for
future use. Under the second system, the women and
children receive slightly better attention, being given
first place at such tables as there are. The most essential
utensils are placed by stewards, and washed by
them afterwards. The food is served in large pans, one
for each table, which are passed along a line of stewards
from the galley, in the manner of a bucket brigade.
This is all the table service there is. The men receive
even less attention. They are divided into groups of
six, and each group is given two large tin pans, and tin
plates, tin cups, and cutlery enough for all. Each man
takes his turn at going after the food, and in caring for
the dishes. The men eat wherever they can find a place.</p>

<p class='c010'>Life under such circumstances must of necessity be
disgusting and degrading, whatever the character or
desires of the individual. The only part of the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>ship which the steerage passenger has a right to call in
any sense his own is the few square feet contained in
his berth. Here he must keep all of his personal belongings.
His hand baggage must be stored in it, or hung
from the pipes above his head. If there are eating
utensils committed to his keeping, they must be concealed
in some corner of the bunk when not in use.
This is the only place to which he may retire in the
search of even the semblance of privacy. It is the only
place where he can recline during the daytime, except
upon the open deck. The berths receive absolutely no
attention from the stewards from the beginning of the
voyage to the end. Is it any wonder that they become
untidy, mussed, and ill smelling? The blankets provided
are usually wholly inadequate for cold weather,
so that passengers are absolutely compelled to sleep in
their day clothing for warmth.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ventilation of the steerage is almost always inadequate,
growing worse the farther down one goes.
The congestion is intense, and even if every provision
were made for cleanliness, the air would inevitably become
foul. Unfortunately such provision is not made.
There are no sick-cans provided for the use of steerage
passengers, and the vomitings of the seasick are allowed
to lie unattended to for hours. Sometimes a steward
comes around with a can of sawdust or sand, but that
is of little avail. Add to this the odors of bodies not
too clean, the reek of food, and the awful stench of the
toilet rooms, and the atmosphere of the steerage becomes
such that it is a marvel that human flesh can endure it.
It is a fact that many of the passengers lie in their berths
for the greater part of the voyage, in a stupor caused by
breathing the vitiated air, indifferent to everything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>around them, unless it be to their meals. If one attempts
to better things by going on deck, and remains above
for any length of time, he finds it almost impossible to
go below again. There are practically only two alternatives;
either to go below for only a few hours of sleep,
and spend practically all the time on deck, or to spend
all the time below.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even if the immigrants desired to keep personally clean,
there is practically no opportunity, owing to the inadequacy
of the wash rooms, the absence of towels, soap, etc.,
and the absolute lack of privacy. Only one who was
trained to make the very most of such facilities could
maintain his decency under such conditions; the bulk
of the immigrants lack even the elements of such training.</p>

<p class='c010'>The food served to steerage passengers is, according
to almost all investigators, usually sufficient in quantity,
and originally of good quality. But in the majority of
cases it is so poorly cooked and served in such an unappetizing
way as to render it most unsatisfactory.
An average menu reads very well; it is only when one
actually undertakes to eat the food, as served to the
immigrants, that the real quality appears. There is
usually a canteen, or bar, where drinks, candy, fruit,
etc., may be secured by those who can pay for them, and
stewards sometimes turn an extra penny by securing
food from the second cabin for steerage passengers who
make the arrangement with them.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the worst conditions prevailing in the steerage,
upon which the investigators of the Immigration Commission
lay great stress, is the indecent and immoral
attitude and conduct of the men, including the crew as
well as the passengers, toward the women. The stories
which are told of the constant persecution of immigrant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>women,—unprovided as they are with any means of
privacy,—even by those whose duty it is to protect them,
are almost unbelievable, but are well substantiated. As
one investigator wrote, only a set of instantaneous photographs
could give an adequate idea of the demoralizing
attentions to which women and girls are subjected, until
even the most self-respecting of them sometimes weaken
under the strain. The United States law, of course, aims
to prevent these abuses, but it is powerless, without
better machinery for enforcement than is provided.</p>

<p class='c010'>All of these conditions are naturally aggravated by
crowding, and are usually more pronounced on the westward
than on the eastward trip, since the steerage is
ordinarily more congested coming to the United States.
It is a marvel that even the ignorant, uncultured, stolid
peasants of Europe can find life tolerable under such
conditions. Yet they do, and manage to get some enjoyment
out of it besides. There are songs and games
and dances to while away the time. Especially when
the ship stops at any intermediate port the deck throngs
with immigrants, men, women, and children, seeking
recreation in their own way.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the whole, the old-type steerage is the poorest
possible introduction to, and preparation for, American
life. It inevitably lowers the standards of decency,
even of the immigrants, and often breaks down their
moral and physical stamina. It shatters their bright
visions of American life, and lands them cynical and embittered.
One of the first steps in the improvement of
the immigration situation should be the abolition of the
old-type steerage.</p>

<p class='c010'>The new-type steerage, which is found on some lines
carrying immigrants from north Europe, was the result
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>of competition for the traffic, which led certain companies
to improve their facilities. The traffic agreement above
referred to, by eliminating this competition, has prevented
the extension of this type of steerage to other
lines, and other ships. In general, the new-type steerage
is a modified second cabin, with simpler and plainer
accommodations, and less attendance. Separate staterooms
are provided, having from two to eight berths in
each; in some cases the berths are of the old steerage
type. The blankets are adequate, and towels, mirrors,
etc., are provided. On some lines the stewards are
responsible for the care of the berths and staterooms.
There are regular dining rooms, properly cared for;
the food is abundant, and when carefully prepared, of
good quality. Facilities for washing and toilet are
superior to the old steerage, and greater segregation of
the sexes is secured. The air is still bad, but not so absolutely
intolerable, and most of the flagrant abuses of the
old-type steerage are avoided. Old and new steerages
are sometimes found on the same vessel, in which case
the latter is known as third class. The difference in
price between the two does not at all correspond to the
wide difference in accommodations; in general, the price
of steerage passage is much nearer to that of second cabin
than the relative service would seem to warrant. This
tends to disprove the claim sometimes made that the
steamship companies cannot afford to furnish better
accommodations to steerage passengers without materially
raising the price, as does the fact that passengers
are actually being carried in the new-type
steerage, with a profit, at a moderate charge.</p>

<p class='c010'>Throughout their long journey from their native
villages to the portals of America, the immigrants are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>very much at the mercy of those into whose hands they
have committed themselves for transportation. Their
treatment differs with different companies, but all too
often they are handled like so many cattle, or even
worse, like so many articles of inanimate freight.<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c018'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The Immigration Commission recommends that a
law be passed requiring United States government
officials, both men and women, to be placed on all ships
carrying third class or steerage passengers, at the expense
of the companies, and that inspectors in the guise of immigrants
should occasionally be sent across in the steerage.
This ought certainly to bring about a decided
improvement in conditions, for at present there is no
provision, on the part of this government, for enforcing
the steerage laws, or looking after the welfare of passengers
on the voyage. Ships are subject to inspection
after they arrive in port, but conditions are very different
then from what they are in mid-ocean. As the ship
approaches shore, toilet rooms and wash rooms are cleaned
up, disinfectants are used, and everything is made to
appear more proper and orderly. That such supervision
and inspection is capable of producing beneficial
results is proved by the fact that on ships carrying an
Italian royal commissioner, conditions are very much
superior to those on others.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER X<br> <span class='c017'>INSPECTION. SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF ARRIVING IMMIGRANTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The immigrant first comes under the official control
of the United States government when he arrives at the
port of destination. There are a number of seaports on
the Atlantic and Pacific coasts designated by the Bureau
as ports of entry for immigrants. Entry at any other
ports is illegal. The facilities for the inspection and care
of immigrants differ in extent in the different ports with
the demands placed upon them, but the general line of
procedure is the same in all. As New York has the most
elaborate and complete immigrant station in the country
and receives three quarters or more of all the immigrants,
it may be taken as typical of the fullest development of
our inspection system.</p>

<p class='c010'>A ship arriving in New York is first subject to examination
by the quarantine officials. Then the immigrants
are turned over to the officers of the Immigration Bureau.
All aliens entering a port of the United States are subject
to the immigration law, and have to submit to inspection.
First or second class passage does not, contrary
to a common impression, secure immunity. Cabin
passengers are given a preliminary inspection by the
officials on board the vessel, and if they are plainly admissible,
they are allowed to land without further formality.
If there is any question as to their eligibility,
they are taken to Ellis Island, and subjected to a closer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>examination. While there, they have to put up with the
same accommodations as are accorded to steerage passengers.
During three months of the spring of 1910
twenty-five hundred cabin passengers were thus taken
over to Ellis Island, and the commissioner in charge at
that port was led to recommend that better facilities
be provided for this class of immigrants.<a id='r144'></a><a href='#f144' class='c018'><sup>[144]</sup></a> This recommendation
was repeated in 1912.</p>

<p class='c010'>The steerage passengers are loaded on to barges,
rented by the steamship companies, and transferred to
the immigrant station. This is located on Ellis Island,
a group of small islands in the harbor, not far from the
Statue of Liberty. It consists of two main parts, on one
of which is located the main building, containing offices,
sleeping rooms, restaurant, inspection rooms, ticket
offices, etc.; on the other are the hospitals, etc. This
temporary disembarkment does not constitute a legal
landing; the immigrants are still nominally on shipboard,
and the transportation companies are responsible
for their support until they are legally landed.</p>

<p class='c010'>After landing on the Island, the immigrants pass
through a detailed process of examination, during which
all the facts required by the statutes are ascertained
and recorded, as far as possible. This examination consists
of three main parts. The first is the medical examination
made by officers of the United States Public
Health and Marine Hospital Service. These inspect
the immigrants for all physical weaknesses or diseases
which make them liable to exclusion. The next stage
is the examination by an inspector who asks the long
list of questions required by the law, in order to determine
whether the alien is, for any nonphysical reason,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>inadmissible. If the immigrant appears to be “clearly
and beyond a doubt” entitled to admission, he passes
on to the discharging quarters, where he is turned over
to the agents of the appropriate transportation company,
or to a “missionary,” or is set free to take his way
to the city by the ferry.</p>

<p class='c010'>If any alien is not clearly entitled to admission, he must
appear before a board of special inquiry, which goes into
his case more deliberately and thoroughly, in order to
determine whether he is legally admissible. Appeal
from the decision of these boards, in cases provided for
by the statutes, may be made either by the alien or by a
dissenting member of the board. Such appeal goes
through the Commissioner and the Commissioner
General of Immigration to the Secretary of Commerce
and Labor, whose decision is final.</p>

<p class='c010'>Many aliens must of necessity be detained on the
Island, either during investigation, or, in case they are
excluded, while awaiting their return to the country
from which they came. The feeding of these aliens,
along with certain other services, is intrusted to
“privilege holders,” selected carefully by government
authority.</p>

<p class='c010'>The volume of business transacted on Ellis Island
each year is immense. There are in all about six
hundred and ten officials, including ninety-five medical
officers and hospital attendants, engaged in administering
the law at this station. The force of interpreters is
probably the largest in the world, gathered under a
single roof. At other immigrant stations the course of
procedure follows the same general lines, though the
amount of business is very much less.<a id='r145'></a><a href='#f145' class='c018'><sup>[145]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>This is obviously one of the most difficult and delicate
of all the branches of government service. Questions
involving the breaking up of families, the annihilation
of long-cherished plans, and a host of other intimate
human relations, even of life and death itself, present
themselves in a steady stream before the inspectors.
Every instinct of humanity argues on the side of leniency
to the ignorant, stolid, abused, and deceived immigrant.
On the other hand, the inspector knows that he
is placed as a guardian of the safety and welfare of his
country. He is charged with the execution of an intricate
and iron-bound set of laws and regulations, into
which his personal feelings and inclinations must not be
allowed to enter. Any lapse into too great leniency is a
betrayal of his trust. One who has not actually reviewed
the cases can have no conception of the intricacy of the
problems which are constantly brought up for decision.</p>

<p class='c010'>Is it surprising that the casual and tender-hearted
visitor who leans over the balcony railing or strolls
through the passages, blissfully ignorant of the laws and
of the meaning of the whole procedure, should think
that he detects instances of brutality and hard-heartedness?
To him, the immigrants are a crowd of poor but
ambitious foreigners, who have left all for the sake of
sharing in the glories of American life, and are now being
ruthlessly and inconsiderately turned back at the very
door by a lot of cruel and indifferent officials. He
writes a letter to his home paper, telling of the
“Brutality at Ellis Island.” Even worse than these
ignorant and sentimental critics are those clever and
malicious writers who, inspired by the transportation
companies or other selfish interests, paint distorted,
misleading, and exaggerated pictures of affairs on Ellis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Island, and to serve their own ends strive to bring into
disrepute government officials who are conscientiously
doing their best to perform a most difficult public duty.<a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c018'><sup>[146]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>It would not be safe to say that there never has been
any brutality on Ellis Island, or that there is none now.
Investigators of some reputation have given specific instances.<a id='r147'></a><a href='#f147' class='c018'><sup>[147]</sup></a>
It would be almost beyond the realm of possibility
that in so large a number of officials, coming in
daily contact with thousands of immigrants, there
should be none who were careless, irritable, impatient,
or vicious. How much of maltreatment there may be
depends very largely upon the character and competency
of the commissioner in charge. The point is, that no
one is qualified to pass an opinion upon the treatment
of immigrants, except a thoroughly trained investigator,
equipped with a full knowledge of the laws and
regulations, and an unbiased mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>One thing in particular which impresses the dilettante
observer is the haste with which proceedings are conducted,
and the physical force which is frequently employed
to push an immigrant in one direction, or hold
him back from another. It must be admitted that
both of these exist—and they are necessary. During
the year 1907 five thousand was fixed as the maximum
number of immigrants who could be examined at Ellis
Island in one day;<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c018'><sup>[148]</sup></a> yet during the spring of that year
more than fifteen thousand immigrants arrived at the
port of New York in a single day. It is evident that
under such conditions haste becomes a necessity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The work has to be done with the equipment provided,
and greater hardship may sometimes be caused by delay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>than by haste. As to the physical handling of immigrants,
this is necessitated by the need for haste, combined
with the condition of the immigrants. We have
seen that the conditions of the voyage are not calculated
to land the immigrant in an alert and clear-headed state.
The bustle, confusion, rush, and size of Ellis Island
complete the work, and leave the average alien in a state
of stupor and bewilderment. He is in no condition to
understand or appreciate a carefully worded explanation
of what he must do, or why he must do it, even if the inspector
had time to give it. The one suggestion which
is immediately comprehensible to him is a pull or a push;
if this is not administered with actual violence, there
is no unkindness in it. An amusing illustration of the
dazed state in which the average immigrant goes through
the inspection is furnished by a story told by one of
the officials on the Island. It is related that President
Roosevelt once visited the Island, in company with other
distinguished citizens. He wished to observe the effect
of a gift of money on an immigrant woman, and fearing
to be recognized, handed a five-dollar gold piece to
another member of the party, requesting him to hand it
to the first woman with a child in her arms who passed
along the line. It was done. The woman took the coin,
slipped it into her dress, and passed on, without even
raising her eyes or giving the slightest indication that
the incident had made any different impression on her
than any of the regular steps in the inspection. It
would be a remarkable man, indeed, who could deal with
a steady stream of foreigners, stolid and unresponsive to
begin with and reduced to such a pitch of stupor, day
after day, without occasionally losing his patience.</p>

<p class='c010'>The information collected at the port of entry is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>sufficient, when compiled and tabulated, to give a very
complete and detailed picture of the character of the arriving
immigrants, in so far as that can be statistically
portrayed. The reports of the Commissioner General
contain an elaborate set of tables, which are the principal
source of accurate information on the subject. In the
following pages these tables will be summarized, with the
intent of bringing out the most important facts which
condition the immigration problem in this country.
Data from other reliable sources will be added as occasion
requires.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the period 1820 to 1912 a total of 29,611,052
immigrants have entered the United States. Of these,
the Germans have made up a larger proportion than any
other single race, amounting in all to 5,400,899 persons
from the German Empire. Until very recently the Irish
have stood second; but as far as can be determined
from the figures the Italians and natives of Austria-Hungary
have now passed them. There have been, in
the period mentioned, 3,511,730 immigrants from Austria-Hungary,
3,426,070 immigrants from Italy, including
Sicily and Sardinia, and 3,069,625 from Ireland.
But if the 1,945,812 immigrants from the United Kingdom
not specified could be properly assigned, it would
probably appear that Ireland could still lay claim to
second place. The other most important sources, with
their respective contributions, are as follows: Russian
Empire, 2,680,525; England, 2,264,284; British North
American possessions, 1,322,085; Sweden, 1,095,940.<a id='r149'></a><a href='#f149' class='c018'><sup>[149]</sup></a>
When it is considered how recent is the origin of the immigration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>from Italy, Russia, and Austria-Hungary,
the significance of these figures becomes apparent. The
figures for a single recent year show very different proportions.
Thus in the year 1907, 28.2 per cent of the
total European immigration came from Austria-Hungary,
23.8 per cent from Italy,<a id='r150'></a><a href='#f150' class='c018'><sup>[150]</sup></a> and 21.6 per cent from the
Russian Empire, while only 3.2 per cent came from the
German Empire, 1.7 per cent from Sweden, 2.9 per
cent from Ireland, and 4.7 per cent from England.<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c018'><sup>[151]</sup></a>
What the ultimate effect of this sweeping change in
nationality will be it is impossible to predict with any
certainty; it is one of the greatest of all the problems
connected with immigration, and can better be
discussed in another connection. Suffice it to say for
the present, that it has put an entirely new face on
the question of the assimilation of the immigrant in
this country.</p>

<p class='c010'>In regard to the sex of the immigrants, the males
have always had the predominance. During the period
from 1820 to 1910, 63.8 per cent of the immigrants were
males, and 36.2 per cent females.<a id='r152'></a><a href='#f152' class='c018'><sup>[152]</sup></a> This is what might
naturally be expected. The first emigration from a
region is almost always an emigration of men. They
have the necessary hardihood and daring to a greater
extent than women, and are better fitted by nature for
the work of pioneering. After the current of emigration
becomes well established, women are found joining in.
Early emigrants send for their families, young men send
for their sweethearts, and even some single women venture
to go to a country where there are friends and relatives.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>But in the majority of cases the number of males continues
to exceed that of females. In the long run, there
will be a greater proportion of men than of women,
because of the natural differences of the sexes. In this
respect, however, there has also been a change in recent
years. The proportion of males is considerably larger
among the new immigrants than among the old. In
the decade 1820–1830, when immigration was still in
its beginning, there was a large proportion of males,
amounting to 70 per cent of the total. In the decades
of the forties and fifties, however, the proportion of
males fell to 59.5 per cent and 58 per cent, respectively.
But in the decade ending 1910, 69.8 per cent of all the
immigrants were males. There is a general tendency
for the proportion of males to rise in a year of large immigration,
and fall as immigration diminishes. This
can be traced with a remarkable degree of regularity
throughout the modern period. It is well exemplified
in the last six years. In the year 1907, when the total
immigration reached its highest record, the proportion
of males also reached the highest point since 1830, 72.4
per cent. After the crisis of that year the total immigration
fell off decidedly, and in 1908 the proportion of
males was only 64.8 per cent. In the next year the percentage
of males rose to 69.2, while the total immigration
decreased slightly; but since the net gain by immigration
increased in that year,<a id='r153'></a><a href='#f153' class='c018'><sup>[153]</sup></a> this is not a serious exception to
the rule. In 1910 the total immigration again showed a
marked increase, and the percentage of males rose to
70.7.<a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c018'><sup>[154]</sup></a> In 1911 there was another marked decline in immigration
and the percentage of males fell to 64.9, while
a further slight decline in 1912 was accompanied by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>fall in the percentage of males to 63.2.<a id='r155'></a><a href='#f155' class='c018'><sup>[155]</sup></a> This phenomenon
is undoubtedly accounted for by the fact that the men
come in more direct response to the economic demands
of this country than the women, and hence respond to
economic fluctuations more readily. Many of the female
immigrants come to join men who have established themselves
on a footing of fair prosperity in this country, and
are able to have them come even in a year of hard times.</p>

<p class='c010'>An examination of the sex distribution of some of the
leading races shows how thoroughly characteristic of the
new immigration this excess of males is. The following
table shows the percentages of the two sexes of certain
chosen races for the eleven-year period 1899 to 1909:</p>

</table>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>Comparing the entire old immigration for the period
specified with the entire new immigration (European
only), we find that of the former 58.5 per cent were male
and 41.5 per cent female; of the latter 73 per cent were
male, and 27 per cent female.<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c018'><sup>[156]</sup></a> It is evident that the
new immigration is in no sense an immigration of families,
but of men, either single men, or married men who
have left their wives on the other side. This is due in
part to the very fact that it is a new immigration, partly
to the fact that it is, to such a large degree, temporary
or provisional. An immigrant who expects to return
to his native land after a few years in America is more
likely to leave his wife behind him than one who bids
farewell to his old home forever. The typical old immigrant,
when he has secured his competency, sends for
his wife to come and join him; the typical new immigrant,
under the same circumstances, in many cases returns
to his native land to spend the remainder of his days in
the enjoyment of his accumulated wealth. The only
exception to this rule is that furnished by the Hebrews,
among whom the sexes are nearly equally distributed.
This is one of the many respects in which they stand
apart from the rest of the new immigration. The only
race in which the female immigrants exceed the males
is the Irish, and this has been the case only within recent
years. During the years of the great Irish immigration
the males predominated.</p>

<p class='c010'>The matter of sex is one of the greatest importance to
the United States. It is one thing to have foreign families
coming here to cast in their lots with this nation
permanently; it is quite another to have large groups of
males coming over, either with the expectation of returning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>ultimately to their native land, or of living in
this country without family connections, for an indefinite
number of years. Such groups form an unnatural
element in our population, and alter the problem of
assimilation very considerably. They are willing to work
for a lower wage than if they were trying to support
families in this country, and are not nearly so likely to
be brought into touch with the molding forces of American
life as are foreign family groups. Their habits of
life, as will appear later,<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c018'><sup>[157]</sup></a> are abnormal, and tend to
result in depreciated morals and physique. Many of
the most unfortunate conditions surrounding the present
immigration situation may be traced to this great preponderance
of males.</p>

<p class='c010'>The one thing that can be said in favor of this state of
affairs is that such a group of immigrants furnishes a
larger number of workers than one more evenly distributed
between the sexes. This is an argument which
will appeal to many; but to many others, who have the
best welfare of the country at heart, it will appear wholly
inadequate to offset the serious disadvantages which
result from the situation. The Immigration Commission
expresses its opinion that, in the effort to reduce the
oversupply of unskilled labor in this country by restricting
immigration, special discrimination should be made
against men unaccompanied by wives or children.<a id='r158'></a><a href='#f158' class='c018'><sup>[158]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In regard to the age of immigrants the most striking
fact is that the great bulk of them are in the middle age
groups. In the year 1912 the distribution of the total
immigration among the different age groups was as
follows: under fourteen years, 13.6 per cent; fourteen to
forty-four years, 80.9 per cent; forty-five years and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>over, 5.5 per cent. In the total population of the United
States the respective percentages in these groups are
about 30, 51, and 19. There is only a slight difference
in this respect between the new and the old immigration.
Of the total European immigration for the years 1899 to
1909, the old immigration had 12.8 per cent in the first
age group, 80.4 per cent in the second, and 6.8 per cent
in the third; the new immigration had 12.2 per cent in
the first, 83.5 per cent in the second, and 4.3 per cent
in the third.<a id='r159'></a><a href='#f159' class='c018'><sup>[159]</sup></a> There is, however, a very marked difference
between the races. This will be brought out by the

<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>already made that our modern immigration is
in no sense an immigration of families. This, too,
affects the chances for assimilation very considerably.
As regards the economic efficiency of the immigrants,
the age distribution, added to the sex distribution, marks
them as a selected group. When it is further considered
that the physically and mentally feeble, and those who
are unlikely to be able to earn their own living are weeded
out in the process of inspection, it appears that those who
look upon the immigrant as nothing more than a source
of cheap labor have much reason to be pleased with the
quality of our immigration. The productive power of a
group of immigrants averages very much higher than a
corresponding number of persons taken from the general
population of the race from which they come.</p>

<p class='c010'>Herein lies perhaps the greatest and most popular
argument for immigration. It is claimed that without
our foreign laboring force it would have been impossible
to develop the resources of the country so rapidly and
completely as they have been developed, and that if the
supply were cut off now, it would seriously cripple the
entire industry of the country. It is certainly true that
under the present organization of industry in this country,
production in many lines depends to a very important
degree upon foreign labor. How much of truth there is
in the deduction that without the immigrants this
country would be much farther back in the industrial
race than it is to-day, will be considered in another connection.<a id='r160'></a><a href='#f160' class='c018'><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>There are many citizens of the United States, however,
who look upon the immigrant as something more than
a mere productive machine. To them the proof of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>his economic efficiency is not sufficient. They wish to
know something of his adaptability to assimilation into
the American life, and of his probable contribution to the
ethnic type of the United States. To such as these, there
are a number of further conditions which must be considered,
and which are of at least equal significance in determining
the final effects of immigration upon this country.</p>

<p class='c010'>Prominent among these is the intellectual quality of
the immigrant. This is naturally a very difficult thing
to measure. Beyond actual feeble-mindedness, the only
test of intellectual capacity which has received wide
application is the literacy—or, as it is more frequently
expressed, the illiteracy—test. This concerns the
ability to read and write, and is given a great deal of
weight by many students of the subject. It is not, however,
necessarily an indication of intellectual capacity,
but rather of education. The inability to read or write
may be due to lack of early opportunity, rather than to
inferior mental caliber. Nevertheless, the matter of
literacy has received sufficient attention, and is in fact
of sufficient importance, so that it is desirable to have
the facts in this respect before us.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two forms of illiteracy are recognized by the immigration
authorities, inability to either read or write,
and inability to write coupled with ability to read.
The latter class is a very small one, and for all practical
purposes those who are spoken of as illiterates are those
who can neither read nor write. For the period of 1899–1909
the average illiteracy of all European immigrants
fourteen years of age or over was 26.6 per cent. There is
a marked difference between the old and new immigrants
in this respect. Of the former class, during the period
mentioned, only 2.7 per cent of the immigrants fourteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>years of age or over was illiterate; of the latter class,
35.6 per cent. The same difference is brought out by
the following table, showing the illiteracy of certain
specified races:</p>

<p class='c010'>Where there is such a marked difference between races
as is exhibited in the foregoing table, it seems fair to
assume that there is a corresponding difference in the
intellectual condition of the respective peoples—if
not in their potential capacity, at least in the actual
mental equipment of the immigrants themselves.<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c018'><sup>[163]</sup></a> In
fact, it is quite customary to take the degree of illiteracy
as a reasonable index of the desirability of a given
stream of immigration. There seems to be considerable
basis for this idea, for it appears probable that an immigrant
who has had the ability and the opportunity
to secure, in his home land, such a degree of education
as is indicated by the ability to read and write, is better
equipped for adapting himself to life in a new country
than one who has not. On the other hand, there is considerable
testimony to the effect that the immigrants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>who have the hardest time to get along in this country
are those who have a moderate degree of education, bookkeepers,
mediocre musicians, clerks, etc. They are
either unable or unwilling to do the menial work which
their less educated countrymen perform, and are not
able to compete with persons trained in this country in
the occupations which they followed at home. There
are relatively few of the occupations into which the
typical immigrant of to-day goes, and for which he is
encouraged to come to this country, in which the ability
to read and write adds to the efficiency of the worker
to any considerable degree. It is possible that the ability
to read and write may hasten the process of assimilation
somewhat; it is questionable whether it adds appreciably
to the economic fitness of the immigrant for life in this
country.</p>

<p class='c010'>The question of literacy as a test of immigrants has
received a large amount of attention recently through
its inclusion in the proposed immigration bill which
barely failed of becoming a law early in the year 1913.
This bill was the result of the investigations of the
Immigration Commission, and embodied several of the
recommendations of that body. The one upon which
most of the opposition was centered was a clause providing
a reading test for adult aliens. There were
certain exceptions to the rule, however, so that in its
actual application the exclusion would have been limited
almost wholly to adult males. The bill passed both
houses of Congress, but was vetoed by the President,
after a careful and judicial consideration. The Senate
promptly passed the bill over the veto, but a similar
action in the House failed by the narrow margin of half
a dozen votes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>The agitation for a literacy test rests upon two main
groups of arguments. The first class includes the efforts
to show that literacy, in itself, is a desirable qualification
for citizenship, economically, socially, and politically.
The second group rests on the belief that the total number
of immigrants ought to be cut down, and that a literacy
test is a good way to accomplish the result. It is not
unlikely that this latter set of opinions predominated over
the former in the minds of the adherents of the proposed
measure, though it was not necessarily expressed openly.
And there is much to be said in favor of the literacy test
from this point of view. In the first place, it is a perfectly
definite and comprehensible test, which could be
applied by the immigrant to himself before he left his
native village. In the second place, it is a test which
any normal alien could prepare himself to meet if he
were willing to make the effort. It does not seem too
much to require of one who wishes to become a member
of the American body politic, that he take the pains to
equip himself with the rudiments of an education before
presenting himself. Finally, as Miss Claghorn has
pointed out,<a id='r164'></a><a href='#f164' class='c018'><sup>[164]</sup></a> it is a test which would react favorably
upon the immigrant himself. It is impossible to tell, as
noted above, just how much value attaches to literacy
in the effort of the alien to maintain himself in this
country. Yet without doubt there is some advantage.
And perhaps there would be even more in the strengthening
of character and purpose which would result from
the effort to attain it. A glance at the preceding table
will show which of the immigrant races, as the immigration
stream is now constituted, would be most affected
by such a test. But it is not at all impossible that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>passage of a literacy test by this government would
have the effect of materially stimulating the progress
of education in some of the more backward countries
of Europe.</p>

<p class='c010'>This tendency to illiteracy on the part of immigrants
is apparently well overcome in the second generation, for
among the employees in manufacturing studied by the
Immigration Commission the percentage of illiteracy
was lower among the native-born descendants of foreign
fathers than among the native-born of native fathers.<a id='r165'></a><a href='#f165' class='c018'><sup>[165]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In the year 1910 information was collected for the
first time in regard to the conjugal condition of immigrants.
The figures on this point are summarized in
the following table, which gives the percentages of each
sex, in the different age groups, who are in the different
classifications as to conjugal condition.</p>

<p class='c010'>This table furnishes further verification of the fact
that our present immigration is in no sense an immigration
of families. More than half of all the immigrants
fourteen years of age or over, of both sexes, are single.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>This affects the problem of assimilation very deeply.
One of the greatest forces for Americanization in immigrant
families is the growing children. Where these
are absent, the adults have much less contact with assimilating
influences. If there was a large degree of
intermarriage between these single immigrants and
native Americans, the aspect of the case would be very
different; but thus far, this is not the case.</p>

<p class='c010'>Much has been said and written about the absolute
economic gain to this country through immigration.
It is pointed out that each year an army of able-bodied
laborers, in the prime of life, is added to our working
force. To the expense of their rearing we have contributed
nothing; they come to us as a free gift from the
nations of Europe. Various efforts have been made to
estimate the actual cash value of these alien laborers.
Professor Mayo-Smith enumerates three different ways
of attacking the problem. The first is by estimating
the cost of bringing up the immigrant, up to the time
of his arrival in the United States. The second is by
estimating his value as if he were a slave. The third is
by estimating the amount of wealth he will contribute to
the community before he dies, minus the cost of his
maintenance—in other words, his net earnings.<a id='r168'></a><a href='#f168' class='c018'><sup>[168]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The lack of uniformity in the results obtained by
different methods and by different investigators gives
weight to the opinion that it is, after all, a rather fruitless
undertaking. To estimate the monetary value of a
man seems to be, as yet, too much for economic science.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is one economic contribution, however, which
the immigrants make to this country which is capable of
fairly accurate measurement. This is the amount of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>money which they bring with them when they come.
For many years immigrants have been compelled to
show the amount of money in their possession, and this
information has been recorded, and incorporated in the
annual reports. Up to 1904, immigrants were divided
into those showing less than $30 and those showing
that amount or more. In that year this dividing line
was raised to $50. The total amount of money shown
is also given. Thus it is possible to estimate the average
amount of money shown by the immigrants of different
races, and also to ascertain what proportion of them
showed above or below the specified amount. Unfortunately
for the conclusiveness of the statistics, immigrants
very commonly do not show all the money in
their possession, but only so much as they think is necessary
to secure their admission. So the total amount of
money shown does not represent the total amount
brought in; all that can be positively stated is that
at least so much was brought in.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1909 the total amount of money shown was $17,331,828;
in 1910, $28,197,745; in 1911, $29,411,488; and
in 1912, $30,353,721. The average per capita showings
of the European immigrants for the period 1905 to 1909
was as follows:<a id='r169'></a><a href='#f169' class='c018'><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>Those not showing money were for the most part children
and other dependents. This shows how baseless is
the impression, quite prevalent among Americans and
aliens alike, that a certain specified amount of money is
necessary to secure admission to this country. Thirty
dollars or fifty dollars are the amounts commonly mentioned.
But since the average based on the total number
showing money is barely over thirty dollars, it is plain
that there must be a large number showing less than
thirty dollars. In fact, some races, as, for instance, the
Polish, Lithuanians, and south Italians, have an average
of from twenty to twenty-five dollars for all showing
money. There is no monetary requirement for admission
to the United States. While the possession of a
certain amount of money is considered to add to the
probability of an immigrant being able to support himself
without becoming a public charge, a sturdy laborer
with ten dollars in his pocket is more likely to secure admission
than a decrepit old man with a good-sized bank
account.</p>

<p class='c010'>Against these large amounts of money brought in by
immigrants, which represent a net gain to the total wealth
of the country, must be set off the enormous amounts of
money annually sent abroad by alien residents of the
United States. Various efforts have been made to estimate
these sums. The best is probably that of the
Immigration Commission which sets the figure at a
total of $275,000,000 for the year 1907, which was a
prosperous year.<a id='r170'></a><a href='#f170' class='c018'><sup>[170]</sup></a></p>

immigrants themselves, and represent, in so far as they
are correct, the economic position of the immigrant in
the country from which he came. They are not a reliable
indication of the occupation into which he goes in this
country.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is evident that the great majority of the immigrants
belong in general to the unskilled labor class. This is
the class of labor for which there is a special demand in
this country, and for which the immigrants are desired.
At the same time, as Professor Commons has pointed
out,<a id='r173'></a><a href='#f173' class='c018'><sup>[173]</sup></a> there is also a considerable demand for skilled
artisans in this country, as the peculiar conditions of
American industry prevent the training of a sufficient
number of all-round mechanics at home. This demand
is also met from European sources. There is a great
difference in this respect between the different races.<a id='r174'></a><a href='#f174' class='c018'><sup>[174]</sup></a>
For instance, 29.8 per cent of the English immigrants
were skilled laborers, 37.9 per cent of the Scotch, and
35.2 per cent of the Welsh, while only 4.7 per cent of the
Croatians and Slovenians, 2.7 per cent of the Roumanians,
1.8 per cent of the Ruthenians, and 3.5 per cent of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>the Slovaks belonged to that class, during the period
mentioned. The highest proportion of professional is
shown by the French, with 6.2 per cent. In general,
the old immigration has a larger proportion in the professional
and skilled groups than the new, and this
difference would be much more marked if the Hebrews
were excepted, as they again furnish a marked exception
to the general rule of the new immigration, with 36.7
per cent in the skilled labor group.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus far, the facts which have been brought out all
have to do with the condition of the immigrants upon
their arrival. They furnish a sort of a composite picture
of the raw material. This is about as far as the regular
statistics go. After the immigrants have left the port
of arrival, the Bureau furnishes practically no information
about them until they leave the country again, except
an occasional special report, and, in recent years,
figures concerning naturalization. This is typical of the
general attitude which characterizes the entire immigration
system and legislation, and rests on the assumption
that if sufficient care is exercised in the selection of immigrants,
all will thenceforth be well, and no attention need
be paid to them after they are in the country. The final
piece of information furnished in the reports is the
alleged destination of the immigrants. This is of course
somewhat uncertain, but in so far as it is conclusive it
furnishes a preliminary clew to the distribution of our
alien residents throughout the country.</p>

<p class='c010'>The significance of the figures regarding destination,
or intended future residence, may best be brought out
by showing the percentages destined to the different
territorial divisions of the United States. In 1910 these
were as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>The fact that in a typical year 88.4 per cent of the
total immigration gave their intended future residence
as the North Atlantic or North Central divisions, introduces
us to some of the peculiarities of the distribution
of immigrants in the United States, which will be further
considered later.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before closing our consideration of arriving immigrants
it will be well to glance briefly at those who arrive, but
are not admitted—in other words, the debarred. We
have seen that the law has grown more and more stringent
in its conditions for admission, and each new statute has
tended to raise the standard. These laws have had a
powerful influence in improving the character of the applicants
for admission, and with the coöperation of the
transportation companies have operated to check the
emigration of the manifestly undesirable to an ever
greater extent. Yet there are every year considerable
numbers of would-be immigrants who have to be turned
back at the portals of the United States. The lot of
these unfortunates is undeniably a hard one, and they
are the objects of much well-deserved sympathy. Everything
possible ought to be done to limit the number of
inadmissible aliens who are allowed to present themselves
at the immigrant stations of this country. The farther
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>back on the road they can be stopped, the better will the
interests of humanity be served. At the same time,
pity for the rejected alien ought not to be allowed to
express itself in unreasonable and unwarranted attacks
upon our system of admission, and the officials who administer
it, as is sometimes done.<a id='r176'></a><a href='#f176' class='c018'><sup>[176]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The statistics of debarments may be indicative of
the character of the applicants, of the stringency of the
laws and the faithfulness of their enforcement, or of the
care of the transportation companies in prosecuting their
examination on the other side. It is impossible to tell
from the figures themselves which of these factors account
for the different fluctuations. It is undoubtedly true
that there has been, in general, a steady improvement in
the care with which immigrants are selected. If, next
year, a million immigrants of the same general character
as prevailed sixty years ago should present themselves
at our gates, the proportion of refusals would soar tremendously.
The following table gives the proportion
of debarments to admissions since 1892.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>In the years 1892 to 1912, 169,132 aliens were refused
admission to the United States. Of these, 58.2 per cent
were debarred on the grounds of pauperism or likelihood
of becoming a public charge, 15.8 per cent were afflicted
with loathsome or dangerous contagious diseases,
and 12.7 per cent were contract laborers. These
three leading causes account for 86.7 per cent of all the
debarments. The other classes of debarred aliens
specified in the reports are as follows: idiots, imbeciles,
feeble-minded, epileptics, insane, tuberculosis (non-contagious),
professional beggars, mental or physical
defects likely to affect ability to earn a living, accompanying
aliens, under sixteen years of age unaccompanied
by parent, assisted aliens, criminals, polygamists,
anarchists, prostitutes, etc., aliens who procure prostitutes,
etc., under passport provision, Section 1, under
provisions Chinese exclusion act, supported by proceeds
of prostitution.</p>

<p class='c010'>There has been a change in the relative importance of
the three leading causes of debarment since 1892. In
that year almost all the debarred aliens were paupers or
likely to become a public charge or contract laborers.
The first of these classes has held its own down to the
present, and still stands far in advance of any other cause
as regards the number refused. The contract labor class
has declined in relative importance. Loathsome and
dangerous contagious diseases were comparatively unimportant
until 1898, when they sprang into prominence,
and have since outstripped contract laborers. This
was due to the classification, in 1897, of trachoma as a
dangerous contagious disease. It has since led the list of
diseases by a large margin. In 1910 there were 2618
cases of trachoma out of a total of 3123 loathsome or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>dangerous contagious diseases. Favus comes next with
111 cases, tuberculosis next with 90, and others 304.
The proportions were about the same in 1908 and 1909.
In 1912 the proportion of trachoma was even greater.</p>

<p class='c010'>Trachoma is the disease popularly known as granular
lids. It attacks the conjunctiva, or mucous lining of the
lids, setting up inflammation. It affects the cornea, forming
ulcers, and may result in partial or total opacity,
which may be permanent or temporary. The determination
of cases of true trachoma appears to be a matter
of some difficulty; the examiners on Ellis Island are
“instructed to regard as trachoma any case wherein
the conjunctiva presents firm, well-marked granulations
which do not have a tendency to disappear when the case
is placed in hygienic surroundings a few days, or does not
yield rapidly to ordinary treatment, even though there
be no evidence of active inflammation at the time of the
examination, nor appreciable discharge, nor as yet any
signs of degenerative or destructive processes.”<a id='r177'></a><a href='#f177' class='c018'><sup>[177]</sup></a> The
necessity for great caution in this matter is increased
by the fact that it is possible by medical treatment to
remove the outward symptoms of trachoma so as to
make it very difficult of detection, though there is no
real cure, and the disease will return later. Many immigrants
who are suffering from this malady take treatment
of this sort before emigrating. It is stated that
in London there are institutions which make a business
of preparing immigrants for admission.<a id='r178'></a><a href='#f178' class='c018'><sup>[178]</sup></a> Statements
emanating from medical sources have recently appeared
in the newspapers to the effect that trachoma is not so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>contagious or dangerous as has been supposed, but they
appear to lack substantiation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Favus is another name for the disease known as ring
worm. It is a vegetable parasite which attacks the hair,
causing it to become dry, brittle, dull, and easily pulled
out. Favus is also susceptible to temporary “cures.”</p>

<p class='c010'>On the whole, the new immigration is more subject
to debarment than the old, particularly for the cause of
trachoma. This is a disease to which the races of southeastern
Europe and Asia Minor are especially liable. A
large part of the Syrians have it. In 1910 more than
3 per cent of all the Syrians who presented themselves
for admission were refused for this cause alone. Inability
for self-support is also much more common among
the new than the old.</p>

<p class='c010'>Reviewing this survey of the arriving immigrants, we
find that as respects age and sex they are a body of persons
remarkably well qualified for productive labor.
The predominating races are now those of southern
and eastern Europe, which are of a decidedly different
stock from the original settlers of this country. There
is a large percentage of illiteracy. The statistics of
conjugal condition, combined with those of sex and age,
show that our present immigration is in no sense an immigration
of families. The great majority of the immigrants
belong to the unskilled or common labor class, or
else have no occupation. The bulk of the immigrants
are destined to the North Atlantic and North Central
divisions of the United States. The immigrants are
a selected body, as far as this can be accomplished by a
strict examination under the law. In spite of the care
exercised by transportation companies on the other side,
a considerable number of aliens are debarred each year,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>mainly for the causes of disease, inability for self-support,
or labor contracts. In almost all of these respects
the old immigration differs to a greater or less extent from
the new, with the exception of the Hebrews, who stand
apart from the rest of the new immigration in a number
of important particulars.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>The student who turns to the investigation of immigration
conditions within the United States at once
finds himself hindered by a serious lack of material. As
has been stated above, the Immigration Bureau furnishes
practically no data concerning our alien residents after
it bids them farewell at the immigration station. The
Census Bureau furnishes certain valuable data, and the
Immigration Commission has recently collected a vast
amount of useful information. Occasional articles appear
in the periodicals, and there are a few books touching
on the subject. But there is a great need for more
concrete, exhaustive, and sympathetic studies of single
racial groups of immigrants, such as has been made by
Miss Emily G. Balch in regard to the Slavs. There
ought also to be a number of conscientious studies of
different phases of immigrant life in this country—what
might be called transverse sections of the problem,
as the other studies are longitudinal sections. A number
of valuable studies of the latter sort have been made
by the Immigration Commission in its reports upon
immigrants in industries, immigrants in cities, immigrants
as charity seekers, etc. Other topics which
might well be considered in a similar manner will be
suggested by the following subjects: housing conditions
among immigrants, the food of immigrants,
the problem of assimilation, family life of the immigrants,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>religious life of the immigrants, etc. Until
more work of this sort has been done most general
conclusions must be admittedly tentative and subject
to revision. Nevertheless, knowledge grows from the
general to the particular, as well as in the reverse order,
and it will not be without profit to review the data
which are already at hand, and establish as many conclusions
with a fair degree of certainty as may be possible.</p>

<p class='c010'>When we remember the remarkable homogeneity of
the inhabitants of the United States at the time of the
Revolution, we seem justified in saying that one conclusion,
at least, is established beyond any doubt, viz.
that immigration to the United States since 1820 has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>resulted in a decided mixture of racial stock. For
good or ill, the racial unity of the American people is a
thing of the past.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is another conclusion which might be drawn
from the above figures, and which is in fact assumed
by many writers, and in most popular discussions of the
subject, which is not so well supported by facts. This
is, that these foreign-born residents of the country,
amounting to one seventh of the total, constitute a net
addition to the population; in other words, that immigration
has increased the total population of the country
by an amount approximately equal to the number of
immigrants, allowing, of course, for removals and deaths.</p>

<p class='c010'>At first glance this may seem almost a self-evident
proposition. That it is not, however, is evidenced by
the strikingly large number of the deeper thinkers on the
subject who hold the opposite view. Of these, the best
known in this connection is General Francis A. Walker.
In his discussion of this problem he says: “Space would
not serve for a full statistical demonstration of the proposition
that immigration, during the period from 1830
to 1860 instead of constituting a net reënforcement to
the population, simply resulted in a replacement of
native by foreign elements; but I believe it would be
practicable to prove this to the satisfaction of every
fair-minded man.”<a id='r180'></a><a href='#f180' class='c018'><sup>[180]</sup></a> Mr. Prescott F. Hall, who quotes
this passage, holds firmly to the same opinion himself,
and cites a number of other writers who are more or less
positive in their statements of the causal relation between
immigration and the diminishing native birth rate.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. F. A. Bushee, whose authority on matters of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>population is well recognized, says, “The multiplication
of foreign peoples has seriously checked the growth of
the old American stock.”<a id='r181'></a><a href='#f181' class='c018'><sup>[181]</sup></a> Mr. Robert Hunter is a
pronounced advocate of this view, and says, “The immigrants
are not additional inhabitants. Their coming
displaces the native stock.”<a id='r182'></a><a href='#f182' class='c018'><sup>[182]</sup></a> Professor John R.
Commons supports this position throughout his discussions
of the subject. An extreme but convincing
opinion is that expressed by Mr. S. G. Fisher in the
<cite>Popular Science Monthly</cite> for December, 1895. After
a careful statistical survey of the growth of population
in the United States he states his conviction that “immigration
has not materially increased, but, on the contrary,
has somewhat decreased the American population....
All the immigrants and all their increase
cannot make up for the loss of the old rate of increase
of the natives.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In view of this imposing weight of authoritative opinion,
it is perhaps surprising that the popular mind still
holds so tenaciously and universally to the belief that
immigration directly increases population. The explanation
probably lies in ignorance of the facts of the
case and of the fundamental laws of population and in the
somewhat abstruse nature of the reasoning by which the
expert conclusions are reached. For it must be admitted
frankly that this is not a proposition which can
be demonstrated in an absolutely conclusive mathematical
way, which will leave no further ground for argument.
The factors affecting population are many and
complicated, including not only immigration, but war,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>vice, hard times, marriage customs, the growth of cities,
and a host of other things. It is far beyond the present
power of social science to define positively the relative
importance of each of the forces involved in producing a
certain phenomenon.</p>

<p class='c010'>The line of argument by which, in general, all writers
such as those to whom reference was made above have
reached their conclusions is as follows. The population
of the United States at the time it became a nation
was almost wholly of native origin. It was a homogeneous
people, of one stock, one language, and one set
of traditions, customs, and beliefs. For the first forty
years of our national life the increase of population was
phenomenal, doubling every twenty-two or twenty-three
years. Malthus chose the North American colonies
as an example of the extreme possibilities of
increase under favorable conditions, and the rate continued
for many years after they ceased to be colonies.
Between 1790 and 1830 the population increased from
less than 4,000,000 to nearly 13,000,000, or 227 per cent
in forty years. An estimate made in 1815, based on the
first three censuses, reckoned the probable population
of the United States in 1900 at 100,235,985. The fact
that it was, instead, only 76,303,387, in spite of the incoming
of 19,115,221 aliens since 1820, shows that there
must have been a tremendous falling-off in the native
birth rate. Careful study reveals the fact that the birth
rate first began to decline appreciably about 1830, just
the period when the effects of immigration first began to
be strongly felt in this country, and that it diminished
progressively with the swelling volume of the immigration
current. Moreover, it was in just those sections
where the immigrants congregated most thickly that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>fall in the native birth rate was most pronounced, even
down to such minor divisions as counties. New England,
which, at the time of the Revolution, held the most
homogeneous population in the country, and had the
highest birth rate, has now the greatest proportion of
foreigners and, as far as the natives at least are concerned,
the lowest birth rate. To such an extent has
this decline gone, that at the present time the native
stock in large sections of New England is not even maintaining
itself. Coincidences of time and place between
the phenomena of immigration and those of the declining
birth rate are so numerous and so striking that, in
the words of General Walker, they “constitute a statistical
demonstration such as is rarely attained in regard
to the operation of any social or economic force.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This line of argument has been so thoroughly and convincingly
expounded by a number of writers that it need
not be dwelt upon further here. Its great weakness is
that which has been anticipated—it lacks mathematical
positiveness. An opponent might readily claim that
the appalling decline in the native birth rate (the existence
of which no one would care to deny) was due to
some one or other of a variety of different causes, or to
several operating together. The sections where the
birth rate is the lowest are not only those where immigration
has been the heaviest. They are also to a large
extent those which are characterized most distinctively
by manufacturing industry, or where the population is
the densest. Why not assign the falling birth rate to
one of these causes?<a id='r183'></a><a href='#f183' class='c018'><sup>[183]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>The best answer to this counterargument is to
strengthen the original position by another and wholly
different course of reasoning. This may be done very
effectively by applying the fundamental and accepted
laws of population to the question in hand, and seeing
how they would work out in such a case. If the conclusion
thus reached coincides with that resulting from
the other method of proof, it will furnish a demonstration
amounting almost to a certainty.</p>

<p class='c010'>For this purpose we must go back to the set of doctrines
first consistently expounded by Malthus, and
known by his name. Though they are now more than a
century old, they still stand as one of the profoundest
contributions to human knowledge. These doctrines are
so familiar to all students of social subjects that the
merest summary will serve the present purpose. This
may be given in the following words.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under favorable circumstances, the reproductive
power of the human species is very great.<a id='r184'></a><a href='#f184' class='c018'><sup>[184]</sup></a> Actual
cases of doubling of population in from twenty to twenty-five
years have been known, and this may be taken as a
maximum standard. But man is dependent for his
existence on the food supply, and, owing to the actual
conditions of production, there is no ground for the hope
that the amount of subsistence of the world or of any
nation can ever be increased at a rate corresponding to
the possible increase of mankind. Consequently, the
growth of the species is always limited by the possibilities
of the increase of the food supply, and as the strength of
the reproductive instinct is very great, population will
always be pressing hard on the limits of subsistence.
The only means of providing for a greater population is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>by increasing the amount of productive land, or, by
improvements in the arts, by making the land already
under cultivation produce more food. Briefly stated,
in any society, population tends to increase up to the
supporting power of the soil. The forces which retard
the growth of population, however, are something more
than starvation in the strictest sense of the word. They
are enumerated by Malthus in a list of what he calls
checks. These naturally fall under two heads: First,
the positive checks, which increase the death rate, viz.
war, famine, pestilence, vice, etc.; these all produce
misery and arise whenever population becomes too dense.
Second, the preventive checks, which limit the birth
rate, such as deferred marriage, celibacy, and voluntary
restriction of births, vicious or otherwise; these are under
the control of the human reason and will, and while
they too entail a degree of suffering, it is not comparable
to that caused by the other class of checks. All civilized
societies have come more and more to employ the preventive
checks, particularly that which is known as
moral restraint.</p>

<p class='c010'>The basic principles of Malthusianism remain as unassailable
as when they were first propounded. But
there have been certain modifications made necessary
by the changing conditions of human society. As already
suggested the preventive checks hold a much larger
place than formerly, and great weight is now attached
to what are known as the institutional checks, such as
the demands of education, late marriages, social obligations,
the “emancipation” of women, and a host of
other customs and conventions which tend more or less
imperceptibly to limit the number of births. Still more
important, in the place of a bare subsistence as the limit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>upon which population is always pressing, has been
substituted the standard of living. This includes all
those necessaries, comforts, and even luxuries which are
customary in the social group in which the individual or
family finds itself placed. The limits of the family group
are not now determined by the amount of bare necessaries
which are essential for the preservation of life—probably
they never were absolutely—but rather by
the amount of advantages which are required to keep
the family in the social stratum to which it belongs or
to which the parents aspire, either for themselves or
for their children. Particularly is this true in a democratic
country like the United States, where social
position depends not so much on rank or birth, as on
wealth and education, both of which are attainable by
effort and sacrifice. It is the desire for the “concentration
of advantages” of this sort which leads to the restriction
of the size of families.</p>

<p class='c010'>With this set of laws in mind, let us seek to determine
the effect which might reasonably be expected to follow
the introduction of a large number of immigrants from
European countries into the American body politic.
In the first place, it will be conceded that the great bulk
of our immigrants represent a much lower standard of
living than is customary among native American workmen
in the occupations into which they go.<a id='r185'></a><a href='#f185' class='c018'><sup>[185]</sup></a> Observation
of conditions in the countries from which the immigrants
come, and in the communities in which they settle
after they arrive, establishes this fact beyond the necessity
of proof. In fact, this difference, as has been shown,
is the underlying reason for their coming.<a id='r186'></a><a href='#f186' class='c018'><sup>[186]</sup></a> Undoubtedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>many of the immigrants raise their standard of living
somewhat after their arrival in this country, but not
nearly up to the American level.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since the immigrant has a lower standard than the
native, he can afford to work for lower wages, and since
the amount of alien labor is so abundant and so easily
available, the standard of wages in the occupations into
which the immigrants go is set by the amount for which
they are willing to work. This amount is lowered still
further by the fact that the immigrant is generally quite
willing to add to the income of his family by putting
his children to work as soon as the law allows—or
earlier if possible—whereas the native ordinarily prefers
to keep his children at home and in school as long
as possible.<a id='r187'></a><a href='#f187' class='c018'><sup>[187]</sup></a> Thus large families become a source of
revenue for one, and an item of expense for the other.
It is obviously impossible for the native to support the
same-sized family in the same degree of comfort on the
new scale of wages as on the old. He is compelled to
choose between two alternatives. Either he may lower
his standard of living and keep the same-sized family, or
limit the size of his family for the sake of the standard
of living. But the lowering of the standard of living is
something which every people—particularly the Americans—resist
strenuously. If it is a question of the
possibility of raising the standard, people often prefer
larger families. This is instanced by the very significant
fact that immigrants to this country do, as a rule, raise
their birth rate very considerably. The foreign-born
birth rate in Massachusetts in 1895 was 50.40, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>is from 12 to 20 higher than in most European
countries.<a id='r188'></a><a href='#f188' class='c018'><sup>[188]</sup></a> But if it is a question of lowering the standard
of living, the opposite course is taken. The standard
of living is a matter of custom, and, when once established,
has a tremendous tenacity. The American laborer
chooses the other alternative. <i>He limits the size
of his family.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>Multiplied by tens of thousands, this expedient results
in seriously checking the growth of population. This
decrease in the number of native children destined to
enter certain occupations makes a greater demand for
alien labor, which is promptly supplied. Thus the invasion
of the American standard goes on progressively,
and gradually these occupations come to be resigned more
and more to foreign labor. Already certain classes of
work are commonly known as “Dago labor,” others as
“Hunkie labor,” etc., and a self-respecting American
parent shudders at the thought of having his child
enter them.</p>

<p class='c010'>This very fact is sometimes used as an excuse for the
whole procedure. It is claimed that the natives are not
displaced, but are simply forced into higher occupations.
Those who were formerly common laborers are now in
positions of authority. While this argument holds true
of individuals, its fallacy when applied to groups is obvious.
There are not nearly enough places of authority
to receive those who are forced out from below. The introduction
of five hundred Slav laborers into a community
may make a demand for a dozen or a score of Americans
in higher positions, but hardly for five hundred. Furthermore,
in so far as this process does actually take place,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>it must result in a lowering of the native birth rate,
for it is a well-known fact that in all modern societies
the higher the social class, the smaller is the average
family.</p>

<p class='c010'>What has been said thus far refers to the limitation of
families after marriage. The same influences work to
produce the same result in another way. The increased
difficulty in earning enough to support a family, due to
immigration, leads countless American young men to
postpone marriage for many years, and perhaps an
equal number to give up marrying altogether. Both
result in a great decrease in the birth rate for society
as a whole.<a id='r189'></a><a href='#f189' class='c018'><sup>[189]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The processes sketched above are mainly volitional.
There is a variety of other influences, which work unconsciously,
but perhaps none the less powerfully, to
accomplish the same result. General Walker asserted
that the shock produced on the American mind by the
miserable class of immigrants in the thirties and forties,
in itself, had a profoundly detrimental effect on the
natural rate of reproduction. Immigration has the
effect of vastly increasing congestion of population, and
congestion limits its growth. Furthermore, in an average
group of immigrants, the males exceed the females by
more than two to one.<a id='r190'></a><a href='#f190' class='c018'><sup>[190]</sup></a> The introduction of such an unnatural
element into the population must limit its reproductive
power.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is thus apparent that the laws of population would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>lead us to expect exactly the result which the statistical
data indicate—a decided fall in the native birth rate,
due to the enormous and ever increasing immigration
into this country. The conclusion thus reached is
corroborated and verified by a host of social workers,
who testify from their own experience and observation.
As an example, note the words of Rev. Walter A.
Rauschenbusch, whose keen insight into social questions
has placed him in the front rank of American thinkers:
“The natives, who suffer by the competition of the immigrants
and who feel the tightening grip of our industrial
development, refuse to bring children into a world
which threatens them with poverty.”<a id='r191'></a><a href='#f191' class='c018'><sup>[191]</sup></a> Whether this
decline in the native birth rate has been sufficient to
offset the high birth rate of the foreign-born, and produce
an actually smaller population than we would have had
without any immigrants since 1820, is impossible of
proof. It seems wholly probable that it has. The
second generation of immigrants themselves feel the
effect of the newcomers, and our foreign population
shows a sharp decline in its birth rate after a generation
of American life.<a id='r192'></a><a href='#f192' class='c018'><sup>[192]</sup></a> At least, if immigration has not positively
lessened our population, we may be certain that
it has failed to increase it to any considerable extent.
Its net result, as far as size of population is concerned, has
been to substitute a very large foreign element, from
various sources, for a native element which would otherwise
have come into being.</p>

<p class='c010'>The size and diversity of this foreign element in the
United States is constantly increasing. The representatives
of different foreign nationalities are becoming ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>more numerous and more important in the life of the
country. In them is embodied the “problem of the
immigrant.”</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the most essential factors conditioning this
problem is the distribution of these foreign residents.
The importance of this aspect of the situation is becoming
more and more felt, and will manifest itself in the
succeeding pages. There are two main sources of official
information on this point. The first of these, the immigration
reports, has already been considered, and its
data taken for what they are worth.<a id='r193'></a><a href='#f193' class='c018'><sup>[193]</sup></a> The other is
the reports of the Bureau of the Census, which give
the actual distribution of the foreign-born, at ten-year
intervals. According to this authority, the per cent
distribution of the foreign-born among the various territorial
divisions in 1900 was as follows:</p>

<p class='c030'><a href='#r196'>196</a>. Twelfth Census, Supp. Anal. and Deriv. Tables, Table 67.</p>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The most striking fact exhibited by this table is the
exceptionally large proportion of the Germans and
Scandinavians who have settled in the North Central
division. It also illustrates further the minor part that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>the Southern and Western divisions have played in the
immigration of all races. The same general showing is
made by the figures for 1910. Thus 74.1 per cent of
the foreign-born from Austria, 86.8 per cent of those from
Hungary, 69.3 per cent of those from Italy, and 72.9
per cent of those from Russia were in the Middle Atlantic
and East North Central divisions. But 35.2 per cent
of the foreign-born from Denmark, 17.1 per cent of those
from Germany, 49.2 per cent of those from Norway, and
32.1 per cent of those from Sweden were in the West
North Central division alone.<a id='r197'></a><a href='#f197' class='c018'><sup>[197]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The significance of these figures can be fully comprehended
only by taking into consideration the questions
of area and density. The statement is often made that
the density of population in the United States is so
small that we still have ample room for an indefinite
number of immigrants. It is pointed out that the
average density of population in the United States is
only 25.6 per square mile (1900), as against 400, 500, or
even more in European countries. If the immigrants
were evenly distributed over the entire territory of the
United States, this argument would have some weight.
But we see that they are not. This is one of the cases
where an average is misleading. The immigrants are
really being concentrated in the most thickly populated
portions of the country. This becomes more evident
if we examine the conditions in certain states. Thus
in 1907, according to the Immigration Report, 6.5 per
cent of the immigrants were destined to Massachusetts,
which in 1900 had a density of 348.9; 30 per cent of
the immigrants were destined to New York, with a
density of 152.6; 17.9 per cent to Pennsylvania, with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>density of 140.1; 8.1 per cent to Illinois, with a density of
86.1; 5.5 per cent to New Jersey, with a density of 250.3;
while little Rhode Island, with a density of 407, was
credited with .9 per cent. It thus appears that these
six states, containing only 5.6 per cent of the total area
of the United States, and with a density in each case
far above the average, received 68.9 per cent of the total
immigration for the year.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is thus apparent that our foreign-born residents
tend irresistibly to congregate in the most densely settled
portions of the country, and in the most densely populated
states. But this is not all. They also tend to
congregate in the largest cities, and in the most congested
sections of those cities. In 1890, 61.4 per cent of
the foreign-born population of the United States were
living in cities of at least 2500 population. In 1900
the percentage had increased to 66.3, while 38.8 per
cent of the entire foreign-born population were huddled
into the few great cities having a population of over
100,000. In the same year only 36.1 per cent of
the native-born population were living in cities of
over 2500. This tendency appears to be increasing
in strength, and is more marked among the members
of the new immigration than among the older
immigrants.<a id='r198'></a><a href='#f198' class='c018'><sup>[198]</sup></a> Thus in 1910 the percentage of foreign-born
living in cities of the specified size had risen
to 72.2.</p>

<p class='c010'>The reasons for this tendency of the foreign-born to
congregate in the most densely settled districts may be
briefly summarized as follows. (1) They land, almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>without exception, in cities, and it is often the easiest
thing for them to stay there. It takes some capital,
knowledge, and enterprise to carry the immigrant any
distance from the port of arrival, unless he has a definite
connection in some other place. Yet it is claimed that,
land them where you would, about the same number of
immigrants would find their way to New York within a
few weeks. (2) Economic opportunities are much more
abundant and varied in the cities than in the country.
(3) Such occupations as are obtainable in the city require
much less capital than the characteristic country
occupations. With a few dollars, an immigrant in the
city can set himself up in some independent business,
depending on turning over his capital rapidly to make a
living. There are so many people in the city, that if
one can manage to serve the most trivial want satisfactorily,
he can get along. But any independent
business in the country requires a larger outlay of capital
than the average immigrant can hope for. The only
country occupation open to him is common farm labor,
and there are other reasons which make him ill adapted
for this. (4) In the cities, the newly arrived immigrant
can keep in close touch with others of his own race and
tongue. In the compact colony of his fellow-countrymen,
he may be sure of companionship, encouragement,
and assistance when needed. It is the most natural
thing in the world for an immigrant to want to settle
where there are numbers of others of his immediate
kind. (5) Knowledge of the English language is much
less essential in the city than in the country. The
presence of others who can speak the same tongue makes
it possible for an immigrant to make a living without
knowing a word of the language of his adopted country,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>as many of them do for year after year. In the rural
districts, however, it is almost impossible for a newly
arrived immigrant to get along at all without a knowledge
of the English language, either in independent
business, or as an employee, unless he settles in a farm
colony of people of his own race, of which there are, of
course, many to be found. (6) Not only is there more
chance of friendly relief from fellow-countrymen, in case
of necessity, in the cities, but public relief agencies and
private benevolences are much more available there than
in the country. (7) The excitement and novelty of
American city life is very attractive to many immigrants—just
as it is to the natives. Trolley cars, skyscrapers,
and moving picture shows are wonderfully alluring
features. In fact, in addition to the considerations which
are peculiar to himself, the immigrant has all the general
incentives to seek the city, which operate upon the
general population, and which have produced so decided
a change in the distribution of population
within the last few decades.<a id='r199'></a><a href='#f199' class='c018'><sup>[199]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The matter of distribution has been treated thus at
length because it is one of the most important aspects
of the entire situation. Many, if not most, of the practical
problems of immigration hinge directly upon the
matter of distribution. Upon it depends the question
whether the immigrant and the economic opportunity,
which is his justification for being in the country, shall
come together. The question of assimilation, which is
largely a question of contact between the newcomer and
the native-born population, is primarily a matter of
distribution. Crime, pauperism, disease, the standard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>of living, morality, education—all, to a greater or less
extent, are dependent upon distribution. No practical
program for the treatment of immigrants, which is not
calculated directly to improve distribution, can hope for
any considerable measure of success.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XII<br> <span class='c017'>CONDITIONS (<i>continued</i>). THE STANDARD OF LIVING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We turn now to a closer study of the life conditions
of the immigrants after they have been admitted to this
country, and have become a part of our body politic.
These conditions affect all the life interests of the alien,
and must, in the end, have a determining influence upon
the desirability of immigration, both from the point of
view of the immigrant and of the United States. They
are manifestly so diverse and complicated as to make
it difficult to frame any classification which will not
overlap, and confuse rather than clarify. In general,
however, we may divide these conditions into two categories,
which are not absolutely exclusive and definite,
but will serve the purposes of arrangement. These are
as follows: (1) Those conditions which are primarily
individual to the immigrant himself, and affect the
general life of the nation only indirectly, because the
immigrant is a resident of that nation. (2) Those conditions
which have to do directly with the life of the immigrant
as a member of society, and immediately affect
the interests and welfare of others besides himself. To
the first category belong such matters as housing conditions,
food, and standard of living in general, wages,
recreations, religious life, certain forms of vice, education,
etc. To the second, pauperism, crime, sex vice,
insanity, contagious diseases, industrial efficiency, trade-union
affiliations, political activities and affiliations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>money brought into and sent out of the country, and
anything which increases or lightens the burdens of the
average citizen of the country. In each of these two
classes, there are conditions which may be considered
as political, religious, economic, and social. Many life
interests belong partly in one category, and partly in
the other. This is especially true of that great class of
facts having to do with marriages, births, and deaths,
which affect first of all the immigrant, but through him
the general population of the country.</p>

<p class='c010'>Among those conditions which are primarily individual,
many of the most important come under the head
of the economic. And many of the most significant
economic conditions may be considered under the head
of the standard of living. It has been said, with a great
deal of truth, that the immigration problem in this
country is largely a matter of a competitive struggle
between different standards of living.</p>

<p class='c010'>Probably no other department of the standard of
living of the immigrants has received such careful study
in recent years as the matter of housing. As a result, we
are now able to draw more accurate general conclusions
in regard to this matter than is possible in respect to
almost any other phase of the standard. Particularly
is this true in regard to conditions in the compact colonies
of our large cities, which, as we have seen, constitute the
characteristic home of the new immigrant, and where
the problem is the greatest. There is also a mass of
reliable information in respect to another characteristic
home of the immigrant, the residence portions of mining
camps, and the smaller manufacturing cities.</p>

<p class='c010'>Up to the present the slum, in spite of all the attacks
upon it, has maintained itself as a permanent feature of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>most of our large cities. But the population of the slum
is not a permanent but an ever changing one. The
unsuccessful, unfortunate, and incapable individuals
remain, but the more ambitious, progressive, and successful
move on to other and better sections. Nevertheless,
the slums are always full; and grow rather than
diminish. There is a never failing supply of new recruits,
in the body of recent immigrants, to take the places of
those who move up. Thus the slum becomes the great
sifting ground of the foreign-born, and tends to become
more and more the abode of the poorest classes of our
population. Not only is there a progression of individuals
through the slum, but some of our cities have
witnessed a most interesting and significant succession
of races along the same course. The natives were displaced
by the Irish; they in turn were crowded out by
the Italians and Jews, and now the Greeks, Syrians,
and allied races are driving out the Italians. Races
may come and races may go, but the slum goes on—forever?</p>

<p class='c010'>The character of the modern tenement has been
sufficiently described by many writers to obviate the
necessity of going into any detailed account of it in the
present connection. Our main concern is the life of the
immigrant within this tenement. The most recent and
reliable information upon this point is that furnished by
the Immigration Commission in their report on Immigrants
in Cities.<a id='r200'></a><a href='#f200' class='c018'><sup>[200]</sup></a> The agents of the Commission made a
detailed study of the most densely congested districts of
New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Cleveland,
Buffalo, and Milwaukee. They found the population of
these districts to consist mainly of members of the recently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>immigrating races. In all seven of these cities Russian
Hebrews and south Italians are among the principal
races represented in the congested districts, while in the
cities on the Great Lakes Poles, Bohemians, and other
Slavic races are relatively more numerous than in the
Atlantic coast cities. Very few families whose heads
were native-born of native fathers were found in these
districts. Nearly one half of the foreign-born heads of
households had come within the last ten years, and over
one fifth within five years. Not only were there very
few native families, but only the remnants of colonies of
Germans, Irish, and Swedes were found.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first point to demand our attention in regard to the
life of the foreign-born within the tenements is the amount
of congestion. Among the households studied by the
Immigration Commission, the average numbers of rooms
per apartment was 3.72. The average number of rooms
per apartment for the households whose head was native-born
white of native father was 4.47, of the native-born
of foreign father 4.34, of the foreign-born 3.64. The
average number of persons per household for the native-born
white of native father was 4.14, for the native-born
of foreign father 4.39, for the foreign-born 5.16. An
interesting indication of the habits of life of some of
the newer immigrating races is given by the fact that
while, among the Greeks, 32.7 per cent of the households
consisted of two persons, and 18.4 per cent of three persons,
8.2 per cent consisted of ten or more persons.
Among the Servians 18.2 per cent of the households consisted
of ten or more persons, and among the Slovenians
11.2 per cent. This is the result, as will appear later,
not of large families, but of the tendency on the part of
the male representatives of these races to group themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>together into large coöperative “households”
(pp. 21, 22, 23).</p>

<p class='c010'>The average number of persons per room in the households
studied was as follows: native-born white of native
father, .93; native-born of foreign father, 1.01; foreign-born,
1.42 (p. 24). Only 51.9 per cent of the native-born
white of native father had one or more persons per
room, 54.7 per cent of the German households, 68.5 per
cent of the Irish, south Italians 91.9 per cent, and Greeks
98 per cent. Of the Slovaks, Slovenians, and Syrians,
90 per cent or more of the households had one or more
persons per room. Two per cent of the Greeks, 2.6 per cent
of the south Italians, and 3 per cent of the Syrians had
four or more persons per room. The number of occupants,
per <i>sleeping</i> room, is of course somewhat higher.
The total average number of persons per sleeping room in
the households whose heads were native-born white of
native father was 1.93; of the foreign-born, 2.39. Two
per cent of the Greek households studied had six or
more persons per sleeping room, as did 2 per cent of
the south Italians and 5.2 per cent of the Slovenians.
Fourteen per cent of all the foreign-born households slept
in all the rooms in their apartments, and 41.1 per cent in
all the rooms except one, while among the native-born
whites of native fathers 2.3 per cent slept in all the rooms,
and 20.2 per cent in all the rooms but one.</p>

<p class='c010'>The foregoing figures may be taken as giving a reliable
summary of the amount of congestion in the crowded
districts of the seven great cities mentioned. It is
painfully evident that conditions exist on a wide scale
in these centers, which are a disgrace to any civilized
country. A large proportion of the lower classes of our
cities are living under conditions which render self-respect,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>cleanliness, and even decency almost impossible.
Moreover, it is apparent that the native-born whites of
native fathers, studied in this investigation, although
representing the lowest portions of that class, rank
decidedly above the foreign-born as far as can be judged
by the degree of congestion. The native-born of foreign
fathers stand between the other two classes. A more
vivid and vital aspect may be given to the picture by
taking some specific instances of life conditions among
various groups of the foreign-born.</p>

<p class='c010'>Among the Italians extreme congestion had manifested
itself as long ago as the decade of the nineties.
The average density of population in the Italian quarter
of the North End of Boston was said to be nearly 1.40
persons per room.<a id='r201'></a><a href='#f201' class='c018'><sup>[201]</sup></a> In the Italian quarter of Philadelphia
investigators found 30 Italian families, numbering 123
persons, living in 34 rooms. In some of the Italian
tenements in this city, lamps were kept burning all day
in some of the rooms, where day could scarcely be distinguished
from night.<a id='r202'></a><a href='#f202' class='c018'><sup>[202]</sup></a> The Jews at this time were only a
little less densely crowded than the Italians. In 1891
nearly one fourth of the whole number of Jews living in
two of the precincts of the North End of Boston were
living with an average of more than two persons to a room
and were found to be very uncleanly in the care of their
homes. Among the Irish an average of 1.24 persons per
room was found in Boston in 1891. On the whole they
kept their tenements cleaner than did the Jews or Italians.<a id='r203'></a><a href='#f203' class='c018'><sup>[203]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Since the beginning of the twentieth century, interest
in the slum population of our cities has centered itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>about the Slavic and other races of southeastern Europe,
even more than about the Italians and Jews.
About one sixth of the entire population of Buffalo, or
80,000 individuals, is Polish. Of these, about 4000
families, representing 20,000 persons, own their homes.
They are said to be thrifty, clean, willing, and neglected.
Nearly all the Poles live in small one and two story
wooden cottages. Good tenement work thirty years
ago avoided the serious structural conditions which prevail
in most cities. The principal evil now in the Polish
section is room-overcrowding. The two-story cottages
hold six or more families, while the older one-story
cottage was built for four families, though the owner is
likely to occupy two of the rear apartments. There
are 15,000 of these cottages, all subject to the tenement
law. A Pole was recently made health commissioner,
and gave promise of being the best incumbent of that
office that Buffalo has ever had. That there is plenty
of work for him to do may be judged from the description
of some of the conditions which prevail.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Counting little bedrooms, living rooms, and kitchens
(and they are pretty nearly indistinguishable), Mr.
Daniels tells us that half the Polish families in Buffalo,
or 40,000 people, average two occupants to a room.
There are beds under beds (trundle beds, by the way,
were once quite respectable), and mattresses piled high
on one bed during the day will cover all the floors at night.
Lodgers in addition to the family are in some sections
almost the rule rather than the exception. Under such
conditions privacy of living, privacy of sleeping, privacy
of dressing, privacy of toilet, privacy for study, are all
impossible, especially in the winter season; and those
who have nerves, which are not confined to the rich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>in spite of an impression to the contrary, are led
near to insanity. Brothers and sisters sleep together
far beyond the age of safety. It begins so, and parents
do not realize how fast children grow, or how dangerous
it all is.”<a id='r204'></a><a href='#f204' class='c018'><sup>[204]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Even in Buffalo, the congestion problem is not limited
to the Poles. The author just quoted describes the
Italians as tending to establish residences in old hotels,
warehouses, and abandoned homesteads, and says,
“As late as 1906 we found Italians living in large rooms,
subdivided by head-high partitions of rope and calico,
with a separate family in each division.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In Milwaukee there are three foci of the tenement
evil, the Italian quarter, the Polish quarter, and the
Jewish quarter. While there are not the large tenement
houses that prevail in larger cities, there are
the same evil conditions in the small cottages of the
laboring class. The following paragraphs give a vivid
picture of some of the conditions in each of these three
sections.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Italian district, “Entering one of these dwellings
we had to duck our heads to escape a shower bath from
leaking pipes above the door. Incidentally, we had to
dodge a crowd of the canine family which did not seem
to be particularly pleased with our visit. The rooms
were dark. Something, which I supposed was food or
intended for food, was bubbling on a little stove. A
friendly goat was playing with the baby on the floor,
and the pigeons cooed cheerily near by. Through the
door of the kitchen we got the odor of the stable. The
horses had the best room. In the middle room, which
was absolutely dark, on a bed of indescribable filth, lay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>an aged woman, groaning with pain from what I judged
to be ulcerated teeth, but which for aught she knew might
have been a more malignant disease. In this single
dwelling, which is not unlike many we saw, there lived
together in ignorant misery one man, two women,
ten children, six dogs, two goats, five pigeons, two
horses, and other animal life which escaped our hurried
observation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the Ghetto, in one building, live seventy-one people,
representing seventeen families. The toilets in the
yard freeze in winter and are clogged in summer. The
overcrowding here is fearful and the filth defies description.
Within the same block are crowded a number of
tenements three and four stories high with basement
dwellings. One of these is used as a Jewish synagogue.
Above and beneath and to the rear this building is
crowded with tenement dwellers. The stairways are
rickety, the rooms filthy, and all are overcrowded. The
toilets for the whole population are in the cellar adjoining
some of the dwelling rooms, reached by a short
stairway. At the time of our visit the floors of this
toilet, both inside and outside, were covered with human
excrement and refuse to a depth of eight to twelve
inches. Into this den of horrors all the population,
male and female, had to go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A typical dwelling of the Polish working people is thus
described. “There is an entrance, perhaps under the
steps, which leads to the apartments below. In this
semibasement in the front lives a family. There are
perhaps two rooms, sometimes only one. In the rear of
this same basement lives another family. Above, on
the first floor, lives another family, likewise in two or
three small rooms; and in the rear is another. Thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>four or more families live in one small cottage—and,
often, in true tenement style, they ‘take in’ boarders....
Here, together, live men, women, children, dogs,
pigeons, and goats in regular tenement and slum
conditions.”<a id='r205'></a><a href='#f205' class='c018'><sup>[205]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Such instances as these, which might be multiplied
almost indefinitely, are individual manifestations of
conditions which are represented <i>en masse</i> by the figures
of the Immigration Commission. It is apparent that
slum conditions exist, fully developed, in other places
than the great cities, and in other types of building than
the regulation tenement. As will be seen later, they may
be found in communities which do not come under the
head of cities at all. The slum is a condition, not a
place, and will crop up in the most unexpected places,
whenever vigilance is relaxed. The slum can never be
eradicated by erecting model dwellings, however well
planned, nor by any other superficial method alone.
The foundation of the slum rests in the social and economic
relations of society, and can be effectually attacked
only through them.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the foregoing quotations, frequent reference is made
to the filthy condition in which the dwellings of the
foreign-born are kept. It is the current idea among a
large class of people that extreme uncleanliness characterizes
the great majority of immigrant homes. Unfortunately
there is all too large a basis of truth for this
impression. Yet there is undoubtedly much exaggeration
on this point in the popular mind. The Immigration
Commission found that out of every 100 homes
investigated in its study of city conditions, 45 were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>kept in good condition, and 84 in either good or fair condition,
though the foreign-born were inferior in this
respect to the native-born. In many cases the filthy
appearance of the streets in the tenement districts is
due to negligence on the part of city authorities, rather
than to indifference on the part of the householders.
“In frequent cases the streets are dirty, while the homes
are clean.”<a id='r206'></a><a href='#f206' class='c018'><sup>[206]</sup></a> Not only is it an error to suppose that all
immigrants are filthy, but it is also untrue that all immigrants
who are filthy are so from choice. While the
standards of decency and cleanliness of many of our
immigrant races are undoubtedly much below those of
the natives, there are many alien families who would
gladly live in a different manner, did not the very conditions
of their existence seem to thrust this one upon
them, or the hardship and sordidness of their daily life
quench whatever native ambition for better things they
might originally have had.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the foregoing paragraphs mention has been made of
the boarder as a characteristic feature of life in the tenements.
He is, in fact, a characteristic feature of the
family life of the newer immigrant wherever found.
Since so large a proportion of the modern immigrants
are single men, or men unaccompanied by their wives
(see p. 191), there is an enormous demand for accommodations
for male immigrants who have no homes of their
own. This demand is met in two main ways. The most
natural, and perhaps the least objectionable, of the two,
where there are a certain number of immigrant families
of the specified race already in this country, is for a family
which has a small apartment to take in one or more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>boarders or lodgers of their own nationality. In this
way they are able to add to their meager income, and
thereby to increase the amount of their monthly savings,
or perhaps to help pay off the mortgage on the house if
they happen to be the owners. The motive is not always
a financial one, however, but occasionally the desire to
furnish a home for some newcomer from the native land,
with whom they are acquainted, or in whom they are
interested for some other reason.<a id='r207'></a><a href='#f207' class='c018'><sup>[207]</sup></a> The second way of
solving the problem is for a number of men to band themselves
together, hire an apartment of some sort, and
carry on coöperative housekeeping in one way or another.
A description of these households will be given later
(p. 247).</p>

<p class='c010'>The keeping of boarders or lodgers<a id='r208'></a><a href='#f208' class='c018'><sup>[208]</sup></a> is a very widespread
practice among our recently immigrating families.</p>

<p class='c010'>Among the households studied by the Immigration
Commission in its investigation of cities, 13 per cent of
the native-born white households kept boarders, and
27.2 per cent of the foreign-born. The following foreign-born
nationalities had high percentages, as shown by the
figures: Russian Hebrews, 32.1 per cent; north Italians,
42.9 per cent; Slovaks, 41 per cent; Magyars, 47.3 per
cent; Lithuanians, 70.3 per cent. A similar showing is
made by the figures given in the report of the Immigration
Commission on Immigrants in Manufacturing
and Mining (abstract quoted). The percentage of households
keeping boarders, as shown in that report, is as
follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>This prevalent custom of taking boarders brings numerous
evils in its train. Foremost among these is the
absolute sacrifice of family life in the households. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>difficult at best to maintain a decent degree of privacy
when the family is left to itself; the intrusion of outsiders
makes it wholly impossible. Secondly, the taking
of boarders tends to increase a congestion which is
likely already to be extreme. Thirdly, it lays additional
burdens upon the already overworked housewife. Its
great advantage is, of course, the increase of the family
income, sometimes to an amount almost double that
which could be obtained without the boarders. Among
the Slavs, for example, women are rare, and are regarded
as very valuable, first as wives, and second as a means
whereby a man may take boarders.<a id='r211'></a><a href='#f211' class='c018'><sup>[211]</sup></a> The arrangements
between the boarders and the housewife differ in different
localities, and under different conditions. In a Colorado
mining camp $10 a month is the customary price for a
regular boarder. A very common arrangement is for
the men to buy each his own food, and pay the woman
to cook it. The sums paid range from $2 to $4 a month
for lodging, washing, and cooking.</p>

<p class='c010'>The life of such a housewife in a coal mining community
has been described in the following words: “The status
of the immigrant housewife from the south and east
of Europe is deplorable. The boarding system followed
is one whereby a fixed sum is paid for lodging, cooking,
washing, and mending; an individual food account
being kept with each lodger. The housewife has the
beds to make each day for a dozen men, their clothing to
wash and mend, their meals to prepare. In many cases
she has also to buy the food, which necessitates many
visits to the store and separate purchases for each boarder.
She has also to carry all the water used from the hydrant
or well, which may be ten or one hundred yards distant.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>When the men return from work it is a part of her
duties to help them in their ablutions by scrubbing their
backs. There are also numerous children to care for and
scores of other tasks demanding her attention. Under
these conditions the marked untidiness of the immigrant
households is not to be wondered at.”<a id='r212'></a><a href='#f212' class='c018'><sup>[212]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The second typical method of providing for the single
male immigrant, mentioned above, is coöperative housekeeping
on the part of a group of men, either with or
without a female housekeeper. This practice is very
common among many of the newer races of immigrants,
as has been suggested. It is a makeshift to which the
foreigner is driven by the absence of a normal number of
women of his own race. In households of this sort are
developed some of the very worst conditions to be found
among our foreign residents.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under this system, a number of men of a certain
foreign race club together and hire an apartment, consisting
of a few rooms in a regular tenement house, or,
very frequently, a large storeroom or warehouse, which
thereupon becomes their home. In order to minimize
expense, the greatest possible number of beds are
provided in each room. If the apartment consists of
a storeroom, it is often fitted up with tiers of bunks
along the sides. Such a room may be used by two sets of
men, one during the day and one during the night. If
some of the men are peddlers, the peanut stands or
barrows will be kept at night in the unoccupied spaces in
the room. The lack of woman’s care in the upkeep of
such apartments is very manifest.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>The meals are either prepared in the apartment or
secured at some near-by restaurant, or the two methods
are combined. In the absence of all semblance of family
life, every possible expedient to reduce expense is adopted,
with the unfortunate results that might be expected.
The following description of such a household will give a
concrete idea of the type:</p>

<p class='c010'>“To-day, in a certain mining town, there are fourteen
Slavs, all unmarried, and with only themselves to support,
who rent one large, formerly abandoned, storeroom.
This is taken care of by a housekeeper, who also prepares
the meals for the men. Each man has his own tin plate,
tin knife, fork, and cup; he has his own ham and bread,
and a place in which to keep them. Some things they
buy in common, the distribution being made by the housekeeper.
For beds the men sleep on bunks arranged along
the walls and resembling shelves in a grocery store.
Each has his own blanket; each carries it out-of-doors to
air when he gets up in the morning, and back again when
he returns from his work at night. The monthly cost of
living to each of these men is not over four dollars. They
spend but little on clothes the year round, contenting
themselves with the cheapest kind of material, and not
infrequently wearing cast-off garments purchased of some
second-hand dealer. For fuel they burn coal from the
culm-banks or wood from along the highway, which
costs them nothing but their labor in gathering it.”<a id='r213'></a><a href='#f213' class='c018'><sup>[213]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>That housing conditions such as have been portrayed
above should prevail so generally all over the country
is a serious indictment against the social and industrial
organization of the United States. It has been intimated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>that these conditions are not in all cases due to the choice
of the immigrant, or to the lack of desire for better things
on his part. Whether they are not, to a large degree,
actually due to the presence of the immigrant in this
country is quite another matter, upon the decision of
which must rest much of the final judgment as to the
desirability of immigration under the present system.</p>

<p class='c010'>Throughout the study of housing conditions among
the foreign-born, it becomes more and more evident that
there is a marked distinction not only between the homes
of the native-born and the foreign-born, but between
those of the older and newer immigrants. By whatever
test the standards of each class are measured, there
is almost invariably a decided discrepancy in favor of the
older races. As regards the number of rooms per apartment,
the size of households, the number of persons per
room, the number of boarders, the care and upkeep of the
apartment, the English, Scandinavians, Germans, and
Irish come much nearer to what might be considered a
reasonable American standard than do the Italians,
either north or south, the Slavs (except perhaps the
Bohemians and Moravians), the Greeks, Syrians,
Bulgarians, etc. This distinction is well brought out in
mining localities, where the newer races have displaced
the older within recent years. A graphic comparison is
given by Mr. F. J. Warne in his book, <cite>The Slav Invasion
and the Mine Workers</cite>. He says that, by the time of
the coming of the Slavs, the Irish, English, Welsh,
Scotch, and German mine workers had grown accustomed
to a “social life of some dignity and comfort.” The
English-speaking mine worker wanted a home and
family. That home was usually a neat, two-story frame
house, with porch and yard. Within were pictures on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>the walls, and carpets on the floors of the best rooms.
He wished to have no one as a permanent resident of the
house save his own family, or very near relatives. He
desired his wife to be well dressed and comfortable, and
his children to have the benefits of school. His wants
were always just beyond his wages, and always increasing.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Slav had no wife and children, and wished none.
“He was satisfied to live in almost any kind of a place,
to wear almost anything that would clothe his nakedness,
and to eat any kind of food that would keep body and
soul together.” He was content to live in a one-room
hut, built of driftwood and roofed with tin from old
powder cans. In the mining towns he drifted to the
poorer and cheaper sections to live. He did not care
with whom or with how many he lived, provided they
were of his own nationality. When two such standards
are brought into competition, it is inevitable that the
higher should yield in some way or other.</p>

<p class='c010'>This difference in standards is undoubtedly due in
part to a difference in natural instincts and aptitudes for
decency and cleanliness between the common classes
of northern and southern Europe, but probably more to
the customary standards to which they have become
habituated in their native land. The effect is the same,
whatever the cause. The new immigrant desires a certain
improvement in his standard as a reward for emigration,
but the new standard need not be by any means the
equivalent of that of the immigrant races which have preceded
him. As long as we continue to draw our immigrants
from more and more backward and undeveloped
nations and races we may expect to see a progressive degradation
in the customary standard of the working people.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are many other considerations besides congestion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>which determine the character of life in the slums.
Many of these have already been suggested in preceding
paragraphs. Prominent among them are ventilation,
sanitary and cooking facilities, light, water supply,
healthfulness of surroundings, and play room for children.
The degree in which evils exist in these particulars, in any
locality, depends primarily upon the stringency of the
local tenement and public health laws, and the energy
and faithfulness of their enforcement. Much is being
accomplished and has been accomplished in recent years
in the direction of securing better conditions. Yet there
is almost infinite room for improvement. The futility of
relying upon the individual benevolence and humanity
of builders, owners, and agents was demonstrated long
ago. Here, of all places, eternal vigilance on the part
of the better classes of society is the price of safety.
Descriptions of the homes of the foreign-born are full of
accounts of dark and absolutely unventilated bedrooms,
houses unprovided with any water supply, filthy outdoor
closets and privy vaults, toilets used by ten or twelve
families conjointly, buildings covering the entire lot,
dooryards flooded with stagnant water and refuse,
basements half filled with water, domestic animals
sharing the limited accommodations with the family,
and a host of other horrors. Detailed descriptions of
these dwellings are unnecessary. Any one interested
may find them in abundance in the accounts of housing
conditions in the poorer sections of our cities and towns,
for, as the Immigration Commission has amply demonstrated,
the slum, wherever found, is distinctively the
home of the foreign-born.<a id='r214'></a><a href='#f214' class='c018'><sup>[214]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>It is almost superfluous to add that there are thousands
of immigrants, even of the newer races, who live in
conditions wholly different from those we have been
discussing. Individuals of every race, in large numbers,
have succeeded in raising themselves from the lowly
estate of their compatriots, and establishing homes of
culture and refinement, even of luxury. Examples of
this class are prominent, and are frequently referred to.
Yet in spite of this, the slum remains the characteristic
home of the average immigrant to this country, and as
such it must be reckoned with.</p>

<p class='c010'>The influence of the slum must of necessity be hampering
and degrading to its denizens. No poorer training
school for American citizens could be devised. Not only is
the life prejudicial to health and morals, and destructive
of ambition, but it precludes practically all incidental
or unconscious contact with the uplifting influences
of American life. Almost the only actively assimilating
agency with which the slum dweller comes into
immediate relationship is the public school, and this
lacks much of its value as an assimilating force in districts
which are so largely foreign that the pupils meet
few, if any, children of native-born parents. Any practical
program for solving the immigration problem must
attack the slum boldly. In the words of Mr. Frederic
Almy, “You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow’s
ear, and you cannot make an American citizen out of a
tenement slum. The slum must go. If you spare the
slum, you will spoil the child.”<a id='r215'></a><a href='#f215' class='c018'><sup>[215]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In regard to the housing conditions of the foreign-born
outside of the larger centers of population it is more
difficult to make generalizations. Fortunately, it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>also less necessary. Some of the foremost housing evils
are essentially city matters. Particularly is it true of
immigrants who have established themselves in independent
agriculture, that they have made a long step
toward Americanization. While every grade of dwelling
may be found among foreign-born agriculturists, from
the wretched hovel of the Italian market gardener to
the home of the Swedish farmer of the Northwest which
ranks with the finest in the land, yet the alien who takes
up his abode in the country has, in many respects, removed
himself from the general problem of the immigrant,
and his living conditions can, with a reasonable
degree of safety, be left to look after themselves. Yet it
has been abundantly proved that slum conditions can
exist even in the country, and in small towns. This is
especially true in mining camps, and in the smaller
manufacturing communities. Some of the worst conditions
of the most crowded sections of the cities are
reproduced in the shacks of the miners or the dwellings
of the factory hands. Overcrowding, bad ventilation,
unsanitary toilet facilities, inadequate heating, and
filth are not city monopolies. The taking of boarders
is especially common in these communities, and, in the
mining towns, brings a peculiar evil with it, in addition to
all the regular disadvantages. This lies in the necessity
which every mine worker is under of bathing every day
after work. In the absence of bathrooms, ablutions are
customarily performed in a tub set in the kitchen, and in
the crowded quarters of the miner’s cabin, the children
of the household are accustomed to the sight of nudity
from their infancy up, to the serious injury of their
moral sense.<a id='r216'></a><a href='#f216' class='c018'><sup>[216]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>It is too often true that the worst conditions prevail
in the company houses. The extreme monotony of these
identical rows of ugly dwellings is in itself sufficiently
depressing. But in addition, it appears that many
employers are wholly oblivious to the higher needs of
their employees, and provide the most meager shelter
which will suffice to keep body and soul together, charging
therefor exorbitant rates. To say that these men
and women are treated like beasts, is putting the case
too mildly, for no well-to-do person would house a valuable
animal as some of these human workers are housed.
The shifting character of the population and the uncertain
duration of a mining camp offer a quasi justification
for some of these evils. Yet a self-respecting
nation should not permit any type of industry to persist
which requires its army of workers to live as do hundreds
of thousands of these faithful toilers.<a id='r217'></a><a href='#f217' class='c018'><sup>[217]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In regard to the food of our immigrant population, such
studies of individual races as have been made seem to
indicate that, while the dietary of the average foreign
family falls far short of what a native American would
consider a satisfactory standard and is very deficient in
variety, yet it is ordinarily sufficient in quantity and in
amount of nourishment. Of course there are countless
immigrant families of the poorer sort, just as there are
of natives, who are habitually undernourished; yet the
ordinary immigrant working family or individual appears
not to suffer for lack of sustaining food. This condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>is made possible by a long habitude in European
countries to an exceedingly simple diet, and by a resulting
knowledge of cheap and nourishing foods. The food
item in the budget of an immigrant family from southern
or eastern Europe is almost incredible to an American.
The average cost of food for an individual immigrant
mine worker in Pennsylvania runs from about $4 to
$10 per month. Among the Italians in Boston, during
the winter months, about a dollar a week will suffice
for the food of a man. The south Italian berry pickers
in New Jersey are said to be able to get along on as little
as 25 cents per week, and other races live almost as
cheaply.<a id='r218'></a><a href='#f218' class='c018'><sup>[218]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>There appears to be a considerable difference in this
respect between the different races, even among the
newer immigrants. The lowest standard prevails among
the south Italians, Greeks, Syrians, Bravas, etc. The
Slavs are inclined to spend more of their increasing income
on food; particularly is meat a more important
part of their diet. The Jews are said to rank well above
the Italians in this regard.</p>

<p class='c010'>The quality and preparation of food leaves much to
be desired. Italian children are sent to the markets of
Boston to gather vegetables which have been thrown
away as unfit for use. A brief walk through the East
Side of New York, with an eye on the push carts, will
convince one of the undesirable quality of some, at least,
of the food eaten by the residents of that section. On
the other hand, the Greek laborers on the railroads of the
West are said to live remarkably well, and themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>complain of the staleness of American food, and object
to our practice of putting everything up in “boxes.”<a id='r219'></a><a href='#f219' class='c018'><sup>[219]</sup></a>
In general, the conclusion of investigators in regard to
the food of our working classes seems to be that the faults
of their dietary lie, not so much in the failure to spend an
adequate amount of money for food, as in wasteful and
ill-judged purchases, unsatisfactory preparation, and
improper balance between the essential food elements
(especially lack of sufficient proteids) and too much fat.
It is not unlikely that in this particular the immigrants
fare better than the natives in the same class. It is
certainly probable that, taken on the whole, the standard
of food of the immigrant families in this country is superior
to that to which they were accustomed in their
native land.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is probably no other aspect of life in which the
immigrant shows at least a superficial Americanization
more quickly than in the matter of clothing. It is a
matter where imitation is easy, and in fact almost inevitable.
Any purchases of clothing made after the
immigrant’s arrival in this country must, almost of
necessity, be American in type. And the younger
generation, at least, are eager to have their exterior appearance
correspond to that of the older residents of their
adopted country,—so eager, often, as to lead them to
adopt the most extreme of the new fashions in cut and
fitting, however cheap and flimsy the materials may be.
In fact, this Americanization affects the immigrants even
before they leave their native home. Officials on Ellis
Island say that it is rare nowadays to see groups of
immigrants arriving clad in their picturesque European
costumes; the prevailing garb now is of the American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>type. It is a strange fact that some writers, apparently
oblivious of the ease of this transition, seem to regard
American clothes as an evidence of real assimilation.</p>

<p class='c010'>As regards physical adequacy of clothing, the immigrant
is probably as well off on the average as his native
fellow-worker. It is not likely that any large proportion
of our working classes actually suffer physical harm
from insufficient clothing, unless it be through lack of
proper protection against dampness, particularly in the
matter of shoes.<a id='r220'></a><a href='#f220' class='c018'><sup>[220]</sup></a> In respect to cleanliness, and even
decency, there is frequently room for improvement among
the immigrants, just as there is among the native-born.
There is, on the other hand, a recognized danger
that the desire for a fashionable appearance, particularly
on the part of the women, may lead to an extreme expenditure
for dress, unwarranted by the family income.<a id='r221'></a><a href='#f221' class='c018'><sup>[221]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The standard of living of any family or individual<a id='r222'></a><a href='#f222' class='c018'><sup>[222]</sup></a>
is the resultant of two principal factors. These are the
desires and appetites of the individual or family and the
amount of income available for the gratification of those
desires and appetites. The casual observer, in forming
his estimate of the immigrant, is in danger of forgetting
the second of these factors, and of assuming that because
the immigrant is found living in a certain status, he is
therefore satisfied with that status and has no ambition
to change it. It has already been hinted, in the foregoing
paragraphs, that this is not the case. A full
understanding of the limitations under which the immigrant
is placed can come only with a study of the
customary wages or income of the class to which he
belongs.</p>

<p class='c010'>The matter of wages is one of the easiest aspects of the
life of the immigrant about which to secure reliable data.
It lends itself readily to exact measurement, averaging,
and tabulation. It is a subject upon which the immigrant
himself can give accurate information if he is so
inclined. As a result, there is a considerable mass of
data in regard to the earnings of the foreign-born, and
it is possible to make trustworthy generalizations thereupon.
The latest and most inclusive figures on this
point are those furnished by the Immigration Commission
in its various reports. Foremost among these
stands the report of Immigrants in Manufacturing and
Mining, which presents the results of a thoroughgoing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>investigation of twenty of the leading industries of the
country, and a less detailed study of sixteen others,
covering in all 17,141 households and 503,732 individuals.
The great majority of these are foreign-born, but there
is a sufficient number of native-born, both of native and
foreign parentage, to serve the purposes of comparison.
The table on the previous page gives the average
annual earnings of employees and the average family
income in the different industries.</p>

<p class='c010'>A noteworthy feature of the above table is the general
excess of average family earnings over the average
earnings of heads of families, showing the extent to which
other members of the family besides the head contribute
to the family support.</p>

<p class='c010'>The average weekly earnings of male employees,
18 years of age or over, distributed according to nativity,
are as follows. (The table includes over 200,000
individuals.)</p>

<p class='c010'>Comparing the last two tables, and noting that while
the average yearly earnings of native-born male employees
of foreign parentage are $100 less than those of the native-born
of native parentage, yet the family income of the
native-born of foreign parentage is $1 more than that
of the native-born of native parentage, the obvious conclusion
might be that the native-born of foreign parentage
are more inclined to rely upon some one besides the
head of the family for part of the income than are the
native-born of native parentage. Closer examination,
however, proves that this is not the case. The following
table gives the percentages of families of different nativities
which receive the entire income from the husband.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Thus there is a smaller proportion of families among
the native-born of foreign fathers who rely upon other
members of the family than the husband for part of the
family income than of the native-born of native father.
It appears that the explanation of the peculiarity which
has been noticed must be either that only the more
prosperous of the native-born of foreign parentage are
heads of families, or that those families of this class which
do receive income from other sources than the husband
receive a much greater total amount than among the
native-born of native father, so as to raise the average.
The former explanation seems the more probable, for
while 67.3 per cent of the male native-born white employees
of native fathers, 20 years of age or over, were
married, only 56.5 per cent of the native-born of foreign
fathers of the same age were married. Native-born employees
of foreign parentage who are old enough to be
the heads of families are predominantly representatives
of the old immigration, and hence stand high on the wage
scale. The very small percentage of families among the
foreign-born which derive their entire income from the
husband indicates the extent to which the children of
this class contribute to the family support, and also the
extent to which boarders are taken.</p>

<p class='c010'>Figures from other sources corroborate, in general,
the showing made in the foregoing tables, with some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>differences in detail. The Immigration Commission in
one of its other reports, namely that on Immigrants in
Cities, gives the average approximate yearly earnings of
over 10,000 male wage workers 18 years of age or over
as follows: native-born white of native father, $595;
native-born of foreign father, $526; foreign-born, $385.<a id='r230'></a><a href='#f230' class='c018'><sup>[230]</sup></a>
These figures are less, throughout, than those presented
in the foregoing tables, and seem to indicate that the
average of wages in cities is less than in the general run
of organized industries throughout the country. It is
probable that a census of city workers would include many
in insignificant industries, and in occupations which could
hardly be classed as industries, where the wage scale is low.</p>

<p class='c010'>The earnings of agricultural laborers on the farms of
western New York range from $1.25 to $1.75 per day of
ten hours. South Italian families of four or five members,
engaged in this kind of work, average from $350 to
$450 for the season, extending from April to November.
Poles, working as general farm laborers the year round,
earn from $18 to $20 per month.<a id='r231'></a><a href='#f231' class='c018'><sup>[231]</sup></a> Among the anthracite
coal miners of Pennsylvania, the average yearly wage of
the contract miners, who make up about twenty-five
per cent of persons employed about the mines, is estimated
at about $600 per year, while “adults in other
classes of mine workers, who form over sixty per cent of
the labor force, do not receive an annual average wage
of $450.”<a id='r232'></a><a href='#f232' class='c018'><sup>[232]</sup></a> In the extensive array of wage figures given
by Mr. Streightoff, distinction is not made between
natives and immigrants, but the general showing harmonizes
so well with what has already been given as to obviate
the necessity of going into this question in further detail.<a id='r233'></a><a href='#f233' class='c018'><sup>[233]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>We are justified in setting down the average earnings of
wage-working adult male immigrants as from $350 to
$650 per year, and the average annual income of immigrant
families at from $500 to $900.</p>

<p class='c010'>The figures given for individual immigrant incomes
have been confined to male workers, for the reasons that
they are representative, and are of primary importance
in determining the status of the immigrant family in this
country. The wages of female workers range on the
average from 30 to 40 per cent below those of males.
Full comparisons are given in the volume of the Immigration
Commission Report on Immigrants in Manufacturing
and Mining.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next question which arises is, to what degree are
these incomes, of individuals and families, adequate to
furnish proper support to an average family of five persons?
This problem involves the determination of the
minimum amount on which a family can live in decency
under existing conditions in America. Numerous efforts
have been made to solve this question. The estimate
of the Bureau of Statistics of Massachusetts is $754.<a id='r234'></a><a href='#f234' class='c018'><sup>[234]</sup></a>
The Charity Organization Society of Buffalo regards
$634 a year as the “lowest tolerable budget which will
allow the bare decencies of life for a family of five.”<a id='r235'></a><a href='#f235' class='c018'><sup>[235]</sup></a>
A special committee of the New York State Conference
of Charities and Corrections in 1907 made the following
estimates as to the income necessary for a family of five
persons in New York City.</p>

<p class='c010'>“$600–$700 is wholly inadequate to maintain a proper
standard of living, and no self-respecting family should
be asked or expected to live on such an income.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“With an income of between $700–$800 a family can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>barely support itself, provided it is subject to no extraordinary
expenditures by reason of sickness, death, or other
untoward circumstances. Such a family can live without
charitable assistance through exceptional management
and in the absence of emergencies.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“$825 is sufficient for the average family of five individuals,
comprising the father, mother, and three children
under 14 years of age to maintain a fairly proper standard
of living in the Borough of Manhattan.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Streightoff summarizes the evidence in the following
words: “It is, then, conservative to set $650 as the
extreme low limit of the Living Wage in cities of the
North, East, and West. Probably $600 is high enough
for the cities of the South. At this wage there can be no
saving, and a minimum of pleasure.”<a id='r236'></a><a href='#f236' class='c018'><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The close correspondence of these various estimates
gives them a high degree of credibility. If we fix these
standards in mind, and then look back over the wage
scales given on the foregoing pages, we are struck with
the utter inadequacy of the annual incomes of the foreign-born
to meet even these minimum requirements
of decency. It is obvious that an enormous number of
immigrant families, if dependent solely on the earnings
of the head of the family, would fall far below any of
these standards, and that many of them, even when adding
to their resources by the labors of wife and children,
and the contributions of boarders, cannot possibly bring
the total income up to the minimum limit. Even the
average income in many occupations is far below this
minimum, and it must be considered that while an average
indicates that there are some above, there must also
be many below, the line. What must be the condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>of those below! The average family income of the foreign-born
studied in the Immigration Commission’s
investigation of the manufacturing and mining industries
was $704. Mr. Frederic Almy states that 96 per cent
of the Poles under investigation in Buffalo earn less by
$110 than the $634 per year which was set as the “lowest
tolerable budget.”<a id='r237'></a><a href='#f237' class='c018'><sup>[237]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>A vast amount of information covering a number of
miscellaneous aspects of human life, which fall under the
general head of the standard of living, is furnished by
the Immigration Commission, in its report on the manufacturing
and mining industries. Some of the most
important of these facts are summarized in the following

<p class='c010'>It is thus apparent how large a proportion of our
foreign-born laborers have not even taken the first essential
step toward assimilation. This evil is, of course,
practically overcome in the second generation. Almost
all of the native-born persons of foreign fathers, six years
of age or over, speak English, though some races show
from 6 to 8 per cent who do not.</p>

<p class='c010'>The percentage who can speak English naturally increases
with the length of residence in the United States,
until a percentage of 83.1 is reached for all foreign-born
employees who have been in the United States ten years
or more. But even in this group a very low percentage
is found among the Cuban and Spanish cigar makers, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>whom almost three fifths are unable to speak the English
language.</p>

<p class='c010'>The age of the immigrant at the time of arriving in the
United States has a great deal to do with the ability to
speak English. The percentage of those who were under
fourteen when they arrived who can speak English is
nearly twice as large as that of those who were fourteen
or over. The reasons for this are the greater adaptability
of the younger immigrants, and their greater opportunities
of going to school. The relatively poor showing
of the females is probably due to their greater segregation,
which prevents them from coming in touch with Americans
or older immigrants of other races.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the special reports of the Immigration Commission
deals with the children of immigrants in schools
and brings out some very significant facts. Practically
all of the information was secured in December, 1908.
Naturally this investigation involved a study of the children
of native-born fathers also. A general investigation
was made in the public schools of thirty cities, including
the first twenty cities in point of population, as shown
by the census of 1900, with the exception of Washington,
D.C., Louisville, Ky., and Jersey City, N.J. An investigation
was also carried on in regard to parochial
schools in twenty-four cities, and an investigation of the
students in seventy-seven institutions of higher learning.
In addition to this general investigation, an intensive
investigation was made in twelve cities, including seven
cities not in the previous list, making a total of thirty-seven
cities in which public schools were studied. The
total number of public school pupils for whom information
was secured was 1,815,217. Thus the investigation
was a very inclusive one, and the results may be taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>as representative of educational conditions in the cities
of the entire country.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of the total number of public school children studied
in the thirty-seven cities, 766,727 were of native-born
fathers, and 1,048,490 of foreign-born fathers. The
children of native-born white fathers constituted 39.5
per cent of the total, while among the children of foreign-born
fathers there were the following percentages of the
total number: Hebrews, 17.6; Germans, 11.6; Italians
(north and south), 6.4; total, native-born father, 42.2
per cent; total, foreign-born father, 57.8 per cent.</p>

<p class='c010'>The different cities show a marked difference in the
proportion of children who come from foreign-born
fathers, as the following table will show:</p>

<p class='c010'>The Slovaks, south Italians, and Magyars have the
largest percentages in the kindergartens, and the Portuguese,
Lithuanians, Slovaks, south Italians, and
Polish the largest percentages in the primary grades.
In the high schools, the Canadians, other than French,
the Scotch, the native-born white, the Welsh, Germans,
Hebrews, and English stand highest. This is due to
two main facts,—the longer residence of these latter
races in the United States, and their greater desire for
a high education for their children, coupled with a greater
ability to give it to them. Especially in the case of the
kindergartens are the newer immigrating races very
eager to have their young children looked after so that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>the mother can be free to work, or otherwise occupy
herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another interesting set of figures is that referring to
the amount of retardation among the pupils of different
nativities. By “retardation” is meant that a pupil is
above the “normal” age for the grade in which he is.
In this respect the children of foreign-born fathers of
the newer immigration are decidedly inferior to those of
the older immigration. The latter, in fact, are on the
whole superior to the children of native-born white
fathers. Of the total number of children of foreign-born
fathers for whom this information was secured,
77.2 per cent were born in the United States, and 28.8
per cent were born abroad. There is a considerably
larger proportion of retardation for those children eight
years of age or over who were born abroad than among
those born in the United States. The proportion retarded
increases as the age at the time of arrival in the
United States advances. The proportion of retardation
is greater among those children whose fathers cannot
speak English than among those who can, and greater
among those whose fathers have not taken out naturalization
papers than among those who have.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>There is a group of peculiar economic institutions
which have been developed by the immigrants in this
country, and which are especially characteristic of the
new immigration. This group includes the padrone
system, the contract labor system, the immigrant bank,
and two or three similar institutions, particularly the
sweating system, which is now practically dependent
on immigrants.</p>

<p class='c010'>The word “padrone” is adopted from the Italian, and
signifies master or “boss.” In its application to American
conditions, it refers to a system of practical slavery,
introduced into this country by the Italians, and subsequently
utilized by a number of other southeastern
European races. When immigration from Italy began
to assume considerable proportions, there were already
in the United States a few Italians who had been here
some time, and had acquired a certain familiarity with the
language and customs of the land. They were thereby
especially fitted to be of assistance to their newly arrived
fellow-countrymen, and also, unfortunately, to exploit
them. In fact, they did both of these things. By way
of assistance, they put the green immigrants in touch
with employers of labor, helped them to find lodgings,
and, in brief, acted as the go-between in every case of
contact between the immigrant and the life of the people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>around him. On the other hand, the padrone charged
the newcomer well for every service rendered, and in too
many cases subjected him to various forms of extortion,
which his ignorance kept him from either recognizing
or preventing. As certain of the newer immigrants
became familiar with the speech and customs of their
new home, they in turn became padrones, and extended
their operations over the ever increasing numbers of
new arrivals. Thus the system spread.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are certain businesses or occupations which are
particularly adapted to the application of this system,
such as railroad labor, peddling, boot-blacking, etc.
The Italians developed it primarily in respect to the
first of these. This race has now practically abandoned
this system in this country, but it has been taken up
by others, and is at present practiced by the Bulgarians,
Turks, Macedonians, Greeks, and Mexicans, and in
some cases among Austrians and Italians.<a id='r242'></a><a href='#f242' class='c018'><sup>[242]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>A more concrete idea of the workings of this system
may be gained by an examination of its operation in a
single industry, as, for instance, the shoe-shining industry
among the Greeks. This business, in a marked
degree, combines the necessary elements for the successful
application of the system,—small capital, cheap unskilled
labor, close supervision, etc.,—and this race is
well adapted to apply it to its extreme extent, partly
from natural aptitude, and partly from custom and
training. For the system, in its main outlines, has long
been familiar in Greece, though some of the most unfortunate
aspects do not develop there.</p>

<p class='c010'>The padrone is a Greek who has been in this country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>for some time, and knows the ways of the land. He
decides to engage in the boot-blacking trade, and to
secure his necessary helpers contracts for a number of
boys from his native land to come over and work for
him for a certain length of time, for a specified sum.
The arrangement is sometimes made with the boys,
sometimes with the parents, but almost always with
the parents’ consent. When these boys arrive, they
are taken to a room or set of rooms, which the padrone
has engaged and which thenceforth are their “home.”
They are at once put to work in the shop of the boss,
and kept at work continuously thereafter, with practically
no time off which they can call their own, except
the meager allowance made for sleep. The hours are
long—twelve, fourteen, or even more hours per day.
The boss furnishes board and lodging, and pays a small
sum in cash, perhaps $200 per year. The rooms are
frightfully overcrowded, miserably ventilated, and wholly
unhygienic. The boys do their own cooking, usually in
relays of two, and the noon meal is eaten hurriedly in a
room in the rear of the shop. The boys are prevented
from attending night school, and are forbidden to talk
to patrons. In every way the padrone tries to discourage
their acquiring knowledge of American ways,
for the system rests on ignorance. In a majority of
cases the padrone takes all the tips given to the boys,
and the boys excuse him on the grounds that wages are
high and expenses great.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is obvious that the boys are wholly at the mercy
of their boss, a mercy the quality of which is sadly
strained. And when a boy does manage to get a grasp
of the English language, and acquire a little independence,
instead of turning traitor to the system, he sets up as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>padrone himself. All investigators, and a number of
the better class of Greeks in this country, agree that this
system is a disgrace to the Greek race, or to any other
race that practices it.<a id='r243'></a><a href='#f243' class='c018'><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The contract labor system is next of kin to the padrone
system. The main differences are that the control of
the boss, outside of working hours, is not so complete,
and the relationship is likely to be of shorter duration.
This system arises from the necessity of the capitalistic
employer of labor getting in touch with the alien workman.
Differences of language, ignorance of the sources
and the means of communication, and a variety of other
perfectly comprehensible reasons, prevent the employer
from enlisting his workers directly, and the laborer from
applying for work in his own person. The natural and
inevitable intermediary is the immigrant who has been
in this country long enough to know the language and
have some influence and acquaintance among employers.
Given this starting point, the process of bringing the
immigrants and the employer together goes along wholly
natural channels, with only minor modifications in the
details. In some cases the employer pays the agent
certain specified wages for each laborer furnished, and
the agent pays whatever is necessary—below that
figure—to secure the workers; sometimes the employer
pays fixed wages to the laborers, and allows the agent
a stated commission for each worker secured. This is
much the more desirable system of the two. In many
cases the agent is retained as overseer in charge of the
men he has secured. The degree of definiteness in these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>arrangements varies all the way from cases where agents
go over to foreign countries, definitely charged with securing
laborers for some employer, to those where the
employer simply lets it be known among his employees
that there will be work for all their friends or relatives
who wish to come, and leaves the leaven to work. It
is becoming more rare for agents in this country to go
abroad in person; the tendency is for them to work in
connection with agents established on the other side.</p>

<p class='c010'>The possibilities of abuse in this system are manifestly
great. The agent customarily advances the passage
money of those brought from abroad, taking a mortgage
far in excess of his actual expense on whatever property
the immigrant has to offer. Rates of interest are exorbitant,
and the terms of the contract all in favor of the
importer.<a id='r244'></a><a href='#f244' class='c018'><sup>[244]</sup></a> Sometimes the immigrant agrees to work for
him seven or eight months, in return for an initial outlay
of not over $100 or $125. In extreme cases, when an
importer has taken mortgages far in excess of his actual
expenditure, he will discharge an entire set of men, in
order to make room for a new lot brought over on similar
terms. The debts of the original group are still binding,
and it is astonishing to note the faithfulness with
which these poor unfortunates, thus thrown on their
own resources, will labor on to pay off these obligations.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not all of the laborers employed under this system
are secured directly from abroad. Many of the more
recent immigrants, who have been in this country for
some time, are almost equally dependent on the contractor
with the absolute “greeners.” Chicago is a
great clearing house for the labor market of the western
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>railroads, and labor agencies, often connected with a
restaurant, or some similar place of business, abound in
the foreign sections.<a id='r245'></a><a href='#f245' class='c018'><sup>[245]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>A great deal of business of this general nature is
carried on by aliens who are not real agents. It is very
frequent for an immigrant to tell a newcomer that if he
will pay him a certain sum of money he will secure him a
position in the establishment where he is himself employed.
All that he really does is to take the newcomer
around and introduce him to the foreman, who
gives him work, if there is any. But the new arrival
considers himself much in the debt of his “friend,” and
more than that, thereafter regards the job as his own
because he has paid for it, and resents discharge for any
reason as an injustice. Conscientious employers naturally
do all they can to discourage such practices, but are
powerless to prevent them. In fact, the eagerness of
earlier immigrants to exploit their newly arrived fellow-countrymen,
not only in this way, but in any other that
promises a profit, is one of the most disheartening
features of the whole immigration situation.</p>

<p class='c010'>It goes without saying that all of these operations,
which involve bringing immigrants into the country
under agreement to labor, are in direct violation of law.
The contract labor clause of the immigration law, if
strictly interpreted and enforced, would exclude practically
every immigrant who had the slightest assurance
of employment awaiting him. In fact, however, as
has been shown above (page 154), the courts have so interpreted
the act as to include under contract laborers
only those who have a definite contract, or those who
come in response to a specific offer or promise of employment.<a id='r246'></a><a href='#f246' class='c018'><sup>[246]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>This kind of a promise or offer is relatively rare.
Nothing so definite is required to induce unskilled
laborers to emigrate. Broad and general assurances of
employment awaiting them are sufficient. The wide
discrepancy between the letter and the interpretation of
the law is unfortunate. This section of the law is the
one upon which immigrants are coached more thoroughly
than on any other, and in addition to the large number of
immigrants who violate the most lenient interpretation,
there must be many others whom the courts would not
hold guilty, who nevertheless believe themselves so and
suffer a corresponding degradation of character. A
third element in the situation, which complicates it still
further, is the interpretation practically placed on the
law by the immigration authorities, which is apparently
more strict than that of the courts. The whole matter of
contract labor needs to be thoroughly reconsidered.</p>

<p class='c010'>In addition to the activities of labor agents and employers,
state boards do a good deal to encourage
immigration, sometimes keeping within the spirit of the
law, and sometimes exceeding it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another member of this same nefarious family is the
peonage system. For a general description of the
system the reader is referred to Professor Commons,
<cite>Races and Immigrants in America</cite>, chapter on Labor.
It has been judicially defined in the following words:
“Peonage is a status or condition of compulsory service
based upon the indebtedness of the peon to the master.
The basic fact is indebtedness.”<a id='r247'></a><a href='#f247' class='c018'><sup>[247]</sup></a> The customary or
typical case is where a laborer receives advances of some
sort from his employer, and then leaves his service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>before the terms of his engagement have been fulfilled,
certainly before he has repaid his employer for the advances.
His employer then procures his arrest, either
under a charge of obtaining money under false pretenses,
or under the labor statutes of the various states. The
employer makes a new agreement with the laborer, that
if he will return to his employment, and work out the
balance of his indebtedness, the criminal procedure will
be dropped.</p>

<p class='c010'>This might seem, on the face of it, a thoroughly just
proceeding. The trouble is that the employer has every
advantage. The laborer is ignorant, and very often the
conditions under which he is to work are grossly misrepresented
to him. Lack of forethought, moreover, is
one of the chief characteristics of ignorant and unintelligent
men. The money or goods advanced to them occupy
a very disproportionate place in their minds, compared
to the work which they agree to perform in the future.
The employer, on the other hand, knows all about the
conditions, and just how much he can afford to pay, and
is able to give himself the best of the bargain by a broad
margin.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Immigration Commission made a thorough investigation
of this subject, and found evidences of
peonage in every state in the Union, except Oklahoma
and Connecticut. In the south, where peonage is
supposed to be most rampant, it was discovered that
most of the peons were supplied by labor agents in New
York City, who seriously misrepresented the conditions
under which they were to work, and in many cases sent
out men wholly unfitted for the work which they were
to do. In the south, however, in spite of the existence
of many cases, it appears that the vigorous prosecutions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>and the willingness of juries to convict, have pretty
well broken up the tendency toward peonage in connection
with aliens.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the west and northwest, cases of technical peonage
were found in the shoe-shining industry, and in some
lumber and railroad camps. But there have been
practically no attempts at prosecution for peonage in
these states.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most surprising fact established by the Commission
in this respect is that probably the most complete
system of peonage in the whole country has existed, not
in the south, but in Maine. Here the employers of
labor in the lumber camps have been obliged to secure
their labor mostly from other states and in the main from
immigrants. Boston is the great labor market for this
industry. The immigrants are given very misleading
accounts of the conditions of their labor, and are engaged
to work for their employers for a specified time. They
are then taken into the forests, sometimes having to
walk sixty or seventy miles to their place of labor, and
kept in the forest all winter.</p>

<p class='c010'>When they learn the extent to which they have been
deceived, many of them are inclined to run away. However,
in February, 1907, a law was passed making it a
criminal offense for a person to “enter into an agreement
to labor for any lumbering operation or in driving logs
and in consideration thereof receive any advances of
goods, money, or transportation, and unreasonably and
with intent to defraud, fail to enter into said employment
as agreed and labor a sufficient length of time to
reimburse his employer for said advances and expenses.”
The general interpretation of the courts has been to
ignore the provision about intent to defraud, or at least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>to put the burden of proof on the defendant, though it
is not specifically provided in the law that failure or
refusal to fulfill the terms of the contract shall be <i>prima
facie</i> evidence of an intent to defraud, as is the case in
the contract labor law of Minnesota and other states.
Employers in other branches of industry have sought to
secure the same protection, but in vain, so that this law
is iniquitous, not only from the point of view of peonage,
but also because it is class legislation. A considerable
amount of peonage has resulted from this law in Maine.<a id='r248'></a><a href='#f248' class='c018'><sup>[248]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The basis of all the evils which have just been discussed
has been seen to lie in the ignorance and helplessness of
the newly arrived immigrant. Knowing nothing of the
language of the country, or of its methods of doing business,
and having no connections with the industrial
system of the country, he is forced to rely on some one
who can supply these factors. Most naturally he turns
to some one of his fellow-countrymen who has been in
this country longer. From that time on, sometimes for
many years, his career is dominated by the older immigrant
to a remarkable degree. Out of this connection has
grown up a peculiar set of institutions, commonly known
as immigrant banks, which have the power for great
good or evil to the immigrant, according to the character
of the men who have them in charge. The origin and
nature of these banks is as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>The foremost ambition of the average immigrant is
the saving of money. The purposes of this saving are
many—to guarantee his own future prosperity, to ease
the lot of friends and relatives at home, to pay off mortgages
and other debts, and, perhaps the most important
of all, to provide the means whereby friends and relatives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>on the other side may join him in the new world. The
prepaid ticket is the final end of much of the saving of
aliens. These accumulations naturally come in small
amounts. Out of a month’s earnings, the immigrant
may save $10 or $15 or even as high as $30. The living
conditions of many of the immigrants make it unsafe
for them to try to keep this money in their lodgings;
they are unfamiliar with, and distrustful of, American
banks. The disposition of their savings which seems
to them the wisest and safest is to intrust them to a
fellow-countryman who is familiar with the ways of the
country and has some means of keeping them safe.
This individual may be the padrone or boss, the lodging-house
keeper, a saloon keeper or grocer, or the steamship
agent from whom the immigrant expects eventually to
purchase the prepaid ticket. In time, immigrants in
these positions get into the habit of receiving small sums
from their fellow-countrymen for safe keeping or on
deposit against some future purchase. As these amounts
accumulate, they become of considerable value to the
holder, who may deposit them in a regular savings bank
at interest, to his own profit, or may invest them in his
business, or may make other speculative investments
with them. To attract such deposits, and increase
their amount, he adds the term “bank” to the name of
his business, so that he now becomes a “Grocer and
Banker,” a “Ticket Agent and Banker,” etc. This
adds a dignity to his position and increases the confidence
of the people in his integrity.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has been intimated in the preceding paragraph
that the immigrant “banker” makes no distinction between
the funds deposited with him and his own property.
This is generally the case. Occasionally the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>banker will keep the deposits in his safe, in the original
wallets in which they were delivered to him,<a id='r249'></a><a href='#f249' class='c018'><sup>[249]</sup></a> or deposit
them in a bank in his wife’s name,<a id='r250'></a><a href='#f250' class='c018'><sup>[250]</sup></a> but these are exceptional
instances. Ordinarily all the money in the
banker’s possession is lumped together, so that the assets
of the “bank” are identical with the general resources
of the proprietor. Furthermore, there is a great amount
of laxity in the giving of receipts to depositors. Sometimes
no written acknowledgment whatever is given;
from this point the character of the receipt varies all
the way up to a regular pass book, and a thorough system
of bookkeeping.</p>

<p class='c010'>From such a beginning as this, these banks have
developed a variety of forms, varying in functions and
in stability. They have been classified by the Immigration
Commission into three main groups, as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I. State and incorporated banks or highly organized
private institutions thoroughly responsible and operated
in a regular manner almost exclusively as a bank. There
are comparatively few of these institutions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“II. Privately owned steamship agencies, and real-estate
offices which masquerade under the name of a
bank, but which are not legally authorized as such. To
this class should be added groceries and saloons in which
the banking functions are clearly defined as apart from
other business. The majority of the banks investigated
are of this class.</p>

<p class='c010'>“III. Banks which may or may not be known as
such, but in which the functions of caring for deposits
and receiving money for transmission abroad are extended
more as an accommodation or as incidental to the
main business of the concern. Saloon keepers, grocers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>boarding houses, barbers, and men engaged in similar
occupations usually conduct this class of banks. It
has been claimed by some that every immigrant saloon
keeper will be found doing a banking business of this
character. This is the largest, as it also is the most
irresponsible, class. It is undoubtedly the hardest
class to regulate, as it is the one about which it is the
most difficult to obtain accurate information.”<a id='r251'></a><a href='#f251' class='c018'><sup>[251]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The hold which these bankers have over their patrons
is due in the first instance to the ignorance of the latter,
and the feeling of security which they have in dealing
with people of their own race. It is increased by the
familiarity which the banker has with business methods
in this country, and names, places, and methods in the
old country. The immigrant banker assumes a decidedly
paternalistic attitude toward his patrons, and renders
them many services not ordinarily associated with a
banking business, such as writing and translating letters,
securing employment, giving legal advice, etc. The
greater the hold thus secured, the wider are the opportunities
for exploitation. In the absence of proper
control, and of the ordinary safeguards of such businesses,
the immigrant depositor is made to suffer extortion
and loss in countless cases. In many cases this is
due to the ignorance of the banker, and his total unfitness
for the assumption of such responsibilities; in
many others, it is due to dishonesty, greed, and willful
intent to defraud. In the panic year of 1907 large
numbers of these banks failed, and sums of money were
lost to immigrants, the importance of which is to be
judged, not so much by the total amounts, as by the
fact that they represented the savings of a large number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>of individuals in meager circumstances. In normal
years, there is a steady loss, due to failures, defalcations,
and abscondings on the part of bankers, and also to the
continual petty frauds, habitually practiced by many of
these men. The trustfulness of the immigrants towards
men of this character is surprising. Instances are known
where men have come into a community, advertised a
bank, and in a few weeks accumulated large sums of
money from the foreigners, with which they promptly
decamped, leaving absolutely no means of redress to
their creditors.</p>

<p class='c010'>The primary functions of these banks are the safe
keeping of money and the transmission of remittances
abroad. Only in exceptional cases do the other banking
functions play an important part. It is estimated that
in 1907 approximately $137,500,000 in foreign remittances
passed through the hands of immigrant bankers,
in sums averaging about $35.<a id='r252'></a><a href='#f252' class='c018'><sup>[252]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>These banks are mostly in the hands of the recently
immigrating races. The reasons for their existence—ignorance
of language and customs, illiteracy, inconvenient
hours kept by American banks, and their luxurious
appearance and requirements of cleanliness—appeal
much less strongly to the immigrants from northwestern
Europe.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another functionary who exercises an extensive, and
often baleful, influence over the immigrant is the notary
public. The position of dignity and influence held by
corresponding officials in foreign countries leads the immigrant
to accord too much confidence and trust to such
persons in the United States, who are often ignorant and
in many cases dishonest men. The nature of the cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>in which the immigrant has recourse to them gives them
a large amount of power over the foreigner, and opens
the way to many petty extortions.</p>

<p class='c010'>All of these exploiting agencies become inextricably
mingled in actual life. The functions of the padrone,
the labor contractor, the employment agent, the steamship
agent, the boarding boss, the saloon keeper, the
grocer, the banker, the notary public—any two or
more of these may be combined in the person of a given
individual, who exercises a corresponding control over the
destiny of those who are dependent on him. His hold over
them rests upon the fact that they are not Americanized,
and it is wholly to his interest to keep them so.<a id='r253'></a><a href='#f253' class='c018'><sup>[253]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The sweat shop is manifestly an institution of the
same general character as those which have just been
discussed, and while it may not owe its origin to the immigrants,
it is now practically dependent on them for
its existence. The main features of this system are
familiar. Its distinctive characteristic is the giving out
of work by manufacturers to contractors, in order that
certain processes may be carried on in the homes of the
workers. It finds its fullest development in the clothing
trade, which at the present time is almost wholly in the
hands of the Jews.</p>

<p class='c010'>The chief evils of the system are the unsanitary conditions
of labor, the long hours, the extensive employment
of women and children, the difficulty of proper
supervision, the low wages, and the complete subjection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>of the workers to the control of the boss. The contractor
himself is often in a precarious financial situation,
being himself a victim of the system. Like the foregoing
institutions, it results from the ignorance and lack
of connection of the workers. Its persistence and wide
spread in this country are due to the constant accessions
of low-grade workers, unassimilated to the conditions of
the country, which immigration furnishes. These supply
the raw material upon which the system feeds. By so
doing they have blocked the efforts of the cities of the
United States to control or abolish this evil.<a id='r254'></a><a href='#f254' class='c018'><sup>[254]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>There is another class of institutions which rests upon
the helplessness of the newly arrived immigrant, which
is, however, an alleviating, rather than an exploiting
agency, and which belongs to the social rather than to
the economic life. This is the immigrant home or aid
society. These institutions are numerous in the seaport
cities where immigrants arrive; there are said to be not
less than sixteen in operation in New York City.<a id='r255'></a><a href='#f255' class='c018'><sup>[255]</sup></a> They
are for the most part benevolent or philanthropic organizations
(at least nominally), and many of them are
under the control of some religious organization. Many
of them work primarily with a single race or people.
Their functions are looking after newly arrived immigrants
who are not met by friends, and forwarding them
to their destinations, furnishing them board and lodging
while in the port of arrival, helping them to find work or
to locate missing acquaintances, and in general safeguarding
them while they are establishing a connection
with some responsible party in this country.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>Most of the immigrants who come to this country
come to join relatives or friends, who generally meet
them at the port of arrival, or send money or transportation
to take them to their destination. But it frequently
happens that the friends or relatives fail to put in an
appearance. In that case the immigration authorities
are unwilling to turn the immigrant adrift unprotected,
especially in the case of unaccompanied women or girls.
Consequently the government has allowed representatives
of homes and aid societies to visit the immigrant
stations, and offer their aid to the immigrants. At
Ellis Island, immigrants whose relatives or friends fail
to call for them are detained five days, and then given
the choice of being sent back to Europe or of leaving
the station in company with some representative of a
home or aid society, often called a “missionary.” If
the latter alternative is chosen, the immigrant is said to
be “discharged” to the given person, who is thereupon
held theoretically responsible that the immigrant shall
not become a public charge. There are three general
classes of immigrants who are thus discharged: (1) Immigrants
whose friends or relatives fail to meet them,
and whom the authorities do not deem it wise to land
unless some one becomes responsible for them. (2) Immigrants
who are without sufficient money to take them
to their destination, and who must be cared for until the
necessary funds are forthcoming. (3) Immigrants, particularly
girls and women, who have no friends or relatives
in this country, and need a home until they can
secure employment. These homes and aid societies
necessarily have something of the nature of employment
agencies, and do a good deal of work of that kind.</p>

<p class='c010'>The amount of work done by these organizations is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>very great. In the calendar year 1907, over 14,800 immigrants
were discharged to such representatives at
Ellis Island by the New York discharging division. This
does not include the total number discharged, as the
boards of special inquiry and the commissioners of immigration
also discharge immigrants.<a id='r256'></a><a href='#f256' class='c018'><sup>[256]</sup></a> Six homes in
New York City cared for a total of 48,275 immigrants
in 1908.<a id='r257'></a><a href='#f257' class='c018'><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>It will be seen at once that these homes and societies
have great power over the immigrants, and are in positions
of immense advantage and responsibility, inasmuch as
the authorities give their representatives a semiofficial
standing, and intrust immigrants to them without
reserve. Unscrupulous and grasping persons, once admitted
to the stations as missionaries, have large opportunities
and every advantage to exploit the immigrants
at will. This is especially true of the homes,
where the immigrants can be charged—and over-charged—for
every possible kind of service.</p>

<p class='c010'>It might appear at first sight that the authorities
would exercise every caution, not only in regard to the
character of the representatives, but as to the character
and conduct of the homes. The investigations of the
Immigration Commission, however, revealed that this
has not always been the case. Not only have many of
the authorities used very little care or discretion in
granting privileges to representatives in their stations,
but they exercised practically no supervision over the
homes themselves, and when the immigrant had once
been discharged to the representative, they paid no more
attention to him or his welfare. The Commission investigated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>carefully 102 immigrant homes and aid societies,
in addition to twenty-five employment agencies,
most of which had some connection with an immigrant
home or aid society. A large amount of misconduct
on the part of representatives was discovered, as well as
undesirable conditions in the homes themselves. Many
of the homes were found to be purely money-making
institutions, where the immigrant was fleeced to the
limit of his resources. The sanitary conditions in some of
them were terrible. Some of the representatives seemed
to care for nothing but to have as many immigrants as
possible discharged to them, and were little more than
runners for their respective homes. “It was the testimony
of some of the leading officials at Ellis Island that
the majority of missionaries and representatives there
care only to secure the discharge of immigrants who
have money and can pay for food and lodging.”<a id='r258'></a><a href='#f258' class='c018'><sup>[258]</sup></a> Some
of the representatives were instrumental in securing the
admission of contract laborers. “About two thirds of
the homes investigated were clean, comfortable, and
sanitary, and about one third were overcrowded, badly
ventilated, filthy and insanitary.”<a id='r259'></a><a href='#f259' class='c018'><sup>[259]</sup></a> Many of the homes
where bad conditions were found were supported by
honest conscientious people, who had been duped and
betrayed by their representatives and managers; others
were intentionally nothing but money-making schemes.</p>

<p class='c010'>These conditions are bad enough in themselves, but
the most serious feature of the situation is the lack of
responsibility and care in placing women and girls out
in employment. The majority of the homes investigated
showed absolutely no sense of their duty and responsibility
in this matter. Only one sixth of them refused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>to place girls in situations where their morals would be
seriously endangered. Many of them were perfectly
willing to supply girls to work in houses of immoral
character.<a id='r260'></a><a href='#f260' class='c018'><sup>[260]</sup></a> There was also a great deal of carelessness
in the investigation of addresses to which girls were sent.
Many of the addresses reported by the societies were
found to be fictitious, many were false, that is, the girls
had never been there, and some of them were admittedly
immoral resorts. It is encouraging to note that since
the investigation of the Commission vigorous measures
have been employed in correcting these evils, and conditions
have greatly improved.</p>

<p class='c010'>The case of the immigrant homes and aid societies is
a remarkable illustration of the eternal vigilance which
is necessary to prevent exploitation and corruption from
flourishing, even in connection with professedly benevolent
agencies, when plastic material is furnished in
such abundance as exists in the immigrant body.<a id='r261'></a><a href='#f261' class='c018'><sup>[261]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The effects of immigration upon the religious life of
the immigrants and of the United States constitute a
great field of research which has been surprisingly neglected,
perhaps because of the difficulty of securing reliable
data and establishing definite conclusions, perhaps
because it has not seemed of sufficient importance to
warrant exhaustive study.</p>

<p class='c010'>One result which has certainly followed the immigration
of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the
twentieth is a vast increase in the number of denominations
and sects organized in this country. The position
of the Roman Catholic Church as a product of immigration
is too obvious to be dwelt upon. The predominance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>of this form of belief among the Irish of the first
half of the nineteenth century, which more than anything
else motived the Native American and Know
Nothing movements, has been maintained to a certain
extent among the Germans, and in later days among the
Italians and Slavs.<a id='r262'></a><a href='#f262' class='c018'><sup>[262]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The census reports on religious bodies unfortunately
give no information as to the nationality of members
and communicants, so that it is impossible to distribute
the adherents of the various sects among the constituent
races. However, out of the list of denominations given
we can pick a number of manifestly foreign origin which
indicate the tremendous diversity of religious forms
which are represented in this country. Among them
are the following: Armenian Church; Buddhists,
Chinese and Japanese; Dunkers; Eastern Orthodox
churches, Russian, Servian, Syrian, and Greek; various
German Evangelical bodies; various Scandinavian Lutheran
bodies; Slovak Evangelical Lutheran Synod; Moravian
bodies; Jewish congregations; Polish national
church; Swedish Evangelical bodies; Hungarian Reformed
Church; Bahais, etc.</p>

<p class='c010'>The total number of organizations covered by the
report of the census for 1906 is 212,230 as reported by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>186 denominations. One hundred and fourteen of these
denominations reported the use of some foreign language
in some of their organizations. Of the denominations
so reporting 12.5 per cent of their organizations,
with 26.3 per cent of their membership, report the use of
foreign languages, either alone or with English. There
are forty-one individual languages included in the report.</p>

<p class='c010'>These facts indicate that, whatever changes the removal
to a new environment involves, and however
much of American life the immigrants adopt, a large
percentage of our foreign population brings its religion
with it, and keeps it. This is not to be wondered at,
as we know that men hold on to their traditional religion
more tenaciously than to almost any other of their
mores and resent interference here most of all. More
than this, it is probably well that it is so. For religion
is the great conserving force of morality, the principal
bulwark of traditional conduct. The perils of the moral
nature of the immigrant in his new home are many.
Trained to repression, restriction, and control, he finds
himself suddenly endowed with liberty and opportunity.
This liberty he is all too likely to interpret as license.
Finding people all around him doing things which have
hitherto seemed to him sinful or immoral, he adopts
the practices, without having acquired the principles
and restraints which safeguard them, and make them
innocuous for Americans. If, along with this shifting
of ethical standards, he loses also his religious sanctions,
his moral danger is great indeed.<a id='r263'></a><a href='#f263' class='c018'><sup>[263]</sup></a> This process has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>particularly observed among the second generation of
Hebrews. In the light of American civilization and public
thought, they find the religion of their fathers discredited.
It appears to them antiquated and unworthy.
They throw it over unreservedly, and with it goes the
whole body of admirable moral precepts and guides,
and the remarkable ethical standards, which have been
indissolubly associated with religious belief in their minds.
The unfortunate part of the process is that nothing takes
the place, either of the religious faith, or of the moral
code. The old, which was good, is forsaken without
adopting the new, which is perhaps better. As a result,
juvenile crime is very prevalent among the Jews, and a
large proportion of those concerned in the white slave
traffic, both men and women, are Hebrews.<a id='r264'></a><a href='#f264' class='c018'><sup>[264]</sup></a> It would
be difficult to say to what extent the bad record of the
second generation of immigrants in regard to criminality
and general lawlessness may be due to similar causes.</p>

<p class='c010'>While the majority of our immigrants are nominally
Christians, there is nevertheless a sufficient demand for
religious guidance to constitute a tremendous foreign
missionary problem within the borders of our own land—the
more so when it is remembered that a large part
of the efforts of some of our foreign missionary boards
is directed toward people who are already nominally
Christians, in their home lands. Many of the religious
denominations are beginning to feel this call, and are
responding to it by special services or organizations,
planned to meet the needs of foreign residents. As
stated above, many religious bodies support missionaries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>on Ellis Island. The Young Men’s Christian Association
devotes especial attention to the foreign-born.
Many foreign groups have societies of a religious character,
aside from their regular church organizations.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet in spite of all that can be said on this side of the
question, there remains an astonishing apathy on the
part of the body of American Protestant churches
toward the religious and moral needs and dangers of the
foreign population, and of the opportunities for service
which it offers. This service might be made of incalculable
benefit not only to the immigrants themselves,
but to their adopted country, whose destiny hangs in
the same balance as theirs. It is true that a group of
ignorant, stolid, perhaps dirty, European peasants on
the streets of one’s own city does not make the same
appeal to his emotions and sympathies as the half-clad
savages which he reads of in the missionary journals.
Yet the spiritual needs of the immigrant group are probably
the greater of the two—at least they are more
immediate—and the receptive attitude of the newly
arrived immigrant toward all elevating influences makes
him a uniquely promising subject for missionary work.</p>

<p class='c010'>The unwillingness on the part of many wealthy and
fashionable churches to accept this responsibility in the
spirit of the founder of the Christian religion may be
attributed to ignorance of actual conditions, to fastidiousness,
or to race prejudice, if not to actual indifference.
But if the church is to fulfill its mission in twentieth
century America, the efforts toward serving the
spiritual needs of the alien must be immensely widened
and strengthened. Reverend Charles Stelzle gives an
ironical epitome of the situation in the story of the
church in New York City which sold its fine building
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>because there were too many foreigners in the neighborhood,
and sent the proceeds to the Board of Foreign
Missions.<a id='r265'></a><a href='#f265' class='c018'><sup>[265]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In regard to that set of social conditions which are
represented by statistics of births, marriages, and deaths,
no definite statistical data for the country at large are
available. The census reports do not make the necessary
distinctions between native and foreign-born to
serve as a basis of comparison. Such a comparison is,
in fact, practically impossible, for the composition of
the foreign-born element of the population in respect to
sex, age, and conjugal condition differs so widely from
that of a normal population that any comparative rates,
based on general statistics, would be meaningless. Thus
a foreign-born death rate, based simply on total deaths
and total population, would probably be remarkably low.
For, as has been shown, the foreign-born population is
largely in the middle age groups. They have passed
the dangerous period of childhood, and many of them,
with advancing age, go home to die. But if compared
with a selected group of native-born, of the same sex
and age, the foreign-born would probably show a high
death rate, on account of the prevalence of industrial
accidents and diseases, and unhygienic living conditions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Similar considerations hold true as regards the birth
rate and marriage rate. In respect to the former, it
has been observed in another connection that the birth
rate of the foreign-born is extraordinarily high for the
first generation. As the length of residence of any foreign
group in this country increases, its birth rate tends to
approach that of the native-born until, as has been said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>“the probability is that when immigrants have lived
with us so long that their grandparents were born in the
land, there is little more difference between the two
stocks in reproductivity than between any other equally
extensive groups taken at random.”<a id='r266'></a><a href='#f266' class='c018'><sup>[266]</sup></a> The study made
by the Immigration Commission of the fecundity of
immigrant women shows that women born of foreign
parents have a much greater fecundity than those born
of native parents.</p>

<p class='c010'>In respect to marriages, comparative rates would
have little meaning unless they could be very carefully
refined. The relative number of foreign-born women
is so small, and the number of men who have left wives
on the other side so large, and the temporary character
of the residence of many aliens so marked, as to put the
entire question of marriage among the foreign-born
into an abnormal status. Many obstacles prevent the
free intermarriage of foreigners with natives. Marriages
between the foreign-born in this country are probably
much more infrequent than would be the case in
a normal population of the same size. Even in the case
of the second generation of immigrants Professor Commons
finds that the proportion of marriages is smaller
than among the native-born.<a id='r267'></a><a href='#f267' class='c018'><sup>[267]</sup></a> The effect of this is to
increase the tendency, already noticed, to augment the
population of this country by new immigration, rather
than by the reproduction of elements already here.</p>

<p class='c010'>For recreation the foreign-born are limited to virtually
the same resources as the natives of the working
class. The dance hall, the moving picture show, the
cheap theater, and the recreation park hold the prominent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>places. For the men of some races the saloon,
and for others the imported coffeehouse, furnish a place
for meeting and social relaxation. The need of recreational
facilities for the working classes, so long neglected
in this country, is beginning to be recognized and met in
every up-to-date American city. In all such advantages
the foreign-born will have their share. There are also
other efforts, such as the revival of folk dancing among
foreign groups, and the giving of dramas which appeal to
the immigrants, which have the foreigner directly in
view. These merit hearty commendation. Yet much
remains to be done. The problem of recreation can be
solved only in connection with the problem of general
industrial conditions. The average adult worker in
many of our industries is too much exhausted at the close
of his day’s work to take much interest in recreation of
any kind. All too often, also, the time and the pecuniary
means are alike lacking for forms of recreation which
would be of great value. There needs to be more recognition
of the fact that the workman, though a foreigner,
must have relaxation and diversion to promote his highest
welfare, just as truly as those in higher stations.<a id='r268'></a><a href='#f268' class='c018'><sup>[268]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XV<br> <span class='c017'>CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE COUNTRY. WAGES. PAUPERISM. CRIME. INSANITY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Turning to those aspects of the immigration situation
in this country which more immediately affect the
life of the American people as a whole, we find that they
group themselves under nine main heads, as follows:
wages and standard of living, pauperism, crime, insanity,
industrial efficiency and progress, amount and distribution
of wealth, crises, social stratification, and politics.
In each of these categories certain preliminary effects
are already observable, and other much more extensive
ones may be predicted on a theoretic and hypothetical
basis.</p>

<p class='c010'>As regards wages, we have already made a careful
study of what may be taken as typical immigrant wages.
The question now is, how have these wages affected the
earnings of the great body of American workmen? Has
this admittedly low wage scale of the foreign labor body
exercised a depressing effect upon the remuneration of
the native American, or has the latter been enabled, by
relinquishing the lower grades of labor to the foreigner,
to avail himself of higher and better paid positions?</p>

<p class='c010'>This question, like many others of its class, involves
the problem of determining what would have happened
if history had been different in some single particular.
It is a most perilous, and often profitless, field to enter.
It is apparently impossible for statisticians to determine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>with certainty what has been the course of real wages
within the past half century or so. There is no doubt
that money wages have gone up. There is also no doubt
that the average price of commodities has gone up. The
question is whether average prices or average wages have
gone up the faster. The most reliable tables covering this
subject are probably those of the Bureau of Labor, and
these have been discontinued since 1907. As far as the
showing which they make can be depended upon, it
seems to indicate that there has been a very slight rise
in the purchasing power of full-time weekly wages since
1890.<a id='r269'></a><a href='#f269' class='c018'><sup>[269]</sup></a> Granting this, the question still remains, would
not the American workman have enjoyed a much greater
increase in real wages during this period, if he had been
allowed to reap the full advantage of his economic position
in the country, without having to meet the competition
of vast numbers of foreign laborers? The answer
to this question must rest on pure theory, as its statistical
proof would involve a reënactment of past history,
which is a manifest impossibility.</p>

<p class='c010'>According to the established laws of economics there
are two ways in which immigration may operate to lower
wages. First, by increasing the supply of labor in the
country, and thereby diminishing the amount of remuneration
which the individual laborer can command.
Second, by introducing a body of laborers whose customary
wage in the countries they come from, and whose
corresponding standard of living, is much lower than the
prevailing standard in the new country. This factor
operates, not by increasing the number of laborers bidding
for employment, but by lowering the amount of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>initial bid on the part of a sufficient number of laborers
to fix the remuneration for the whole lot. As to the
first of these ways, if the argument contained in Chapter
XI is valid, it is not probable that in the long run immigration
has materially increased the total population
of the United States. But it has, from time to time,
caused a marked temporary increase in the body of unskilled
labor, and this, as will be shown later, is an important
matter. However this may be, the second of
these two ways has undoubtedly been by far the more
instrumental in reducing the average wage of the American
workman. It is not because he has had to compete
with more laborers, so much as with cheaper laborers,
that the American workman has failed to secure a higher
remuneration for his services. It is what Professor
Commons has called the “competitive struggle for standards
of living”<a id='r270'></a><a href='#f270' class='c018'><sup>[270]</sup></a> which has been the determining factor,
and the whole matter can be best understood by taking
it up in the light of the general standard of living, rather
than of mere wages.</p>

<p class='c010'>The standard of living is the index of the comfort and
true prosperity of a nation. A high standard is a priceless
heritage, which ought to be guarded at all cost.
The United States has always prided itself on the high
standard of living of its common people, but has not
always understood on what that standard rests. The
standard of living is the resultant of two great factors,
the stage of the arts, and the ratio of men to land. It
may be improved by bettering the methods of production
and utilization of natural resources, or by reducing the
ratio between men and land, <i>i.e.</i> by limiting the increase
of population. It may be lowered either by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>retrogression in the stage of the arts—something which
can hardly be conceived of under our present civilization—or
by an increase in the ratio between men and land.
Both of these suppositions assume that the amount of
land remains stationary. If large tracts of good land
are made available by any means, it gives opportunity
for a decided improvement in the standard of living, and
if we can conceive of large areas of good land being
actually lost, there would be an inevitable lowering in
the standard. In point of fact, standards of living are
much more likely to go up than down. The history of
civilization has been that of increasing standards. A
retrogression in the stage of the arts is not likely to take
place on a large scale; neither is it probable that, other
things being equal, men will increase their rate of reproduction,
for the very reason that such an increase
would involve a lowering in the standard of living.</p>

<p class='c010'>A standard of living, once established, has great tenacity,
and people will suffer almost anything in the way
of hardship before they will reduce it. If, for any reason,
the dilemma is presented to a people of lowering their
standard or of limiting their rate of increase, they will in
general adopt the latter alternative. This will come
about, not so much as the result of a conscious choice,
as by the unconscious adaptation to surrounding conditions.<a id='r271'></a><a href='#f271' class='c018'><sup>[271]</sup></a>
On the other hand, if natural conditions are
gradually and steadily improving, it may frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>happen that the rate of reproduction will keep pace
therewith, so that the standard of living will remain essentially
the same. But if some sudden improvement in
conditions appears—like the opening up of great
stretches of new land, or some far-reaching improvement
in the arts—the standard of living may rise appreciably
before the forces of reproduction have had time to offset
the new advantage. In other words, the rise of standards
of living does not take place ordinarily by a steady
and unvarying progress, so much as by successive steps
or waves. The regular, continuous improvements in
conditions account for lifted standards less than the
exceptional, epochal occurrences. Such occurrences,
being inherent in the cosmic laws and in the constitution
of human nature, transpire with sufficient frequency to
make possible great advances in standards of living over
long periods of time.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let us apply these principles to the case of the United
States, and seek to determine what part immigration
has played in their operation.<a id='r272'></a><a href='#f272' class='c018'><sup>[272]</sup></a> At the beginning of its
career the United States was most favorably circumstanced
as regards its standard of living. A people
whose knowledge of the arts represented the highest
product of the civilization of the day was set down in a
practically uninhabited country, apparently unlimited in
extent, and of marvelous fertility and abundance of
natural resources. All of the old checks to population
were removed, and there resulted a natural increase of
numbers unprecedented for a corresponding area and
extent of time in the annals of the race. But even this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>could not keep up with the development of natural
resources, and a general standard of living was established
far ahead of any other nation of the period.</p>

<p class='c010'>Into this favored section of the earth’s surface have
been introduced ever increasing numbers of the lower
classes of foreign nations. What has been their effect
upon the prevailing standard of living? As a major
premise, it will be granted that the standard of living of
the working classes of the United States has been and
still is superior to that of the nations which have furnished
the bulk of the immigrants. Common observation
and general testimony establish this beyond the need of
proof. Particularly at the present time, if this were
not so, very few of our immigrants would come, for, as
we have seen, this is the great incentive which draws
them.<a id='r273'></a><a href='#f273' class='c018'><sup>[273]</sup></a> It is significant, however, that the bulk of immigration
has been recruited from more and more backward
races of Europe as the decades have succeeded
each other. There is not now the relative advantage
for the peasant of England, Germany, or Scandinavia
that there was during the first two thirds of the nineteenth
century.<a id='r274'></a><a href='#f274' class='c018'><sup>[274]</sup></a> As regards the new immigrants—those
who have come during the last thirty years—the
one great reason for their coming is that they believe
that on the wage which they can receive in America they
can establish a higher standard than the one to which
they have been accustomed. And this wage for which
they are willing to sell their labor is in general appreciably
below that which the native American workman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>requires to support his standard.<a id='r275'></a><a href='#f275' class='c018'><sup>[275]</sup></a> What does this
mean? It means in the first place that the American
workman is continually underbid in the labor market
by vast numbers of alien laborers who can do his work
approximately as well as he. But it means more than
this. It means that he is denied the opportunity of
profiting by those exceptionally advantageous periods
which as we have seen recur from time to time, and provide
the possibility of an improved standard. From
his point of view these periods include any circumstances
which occasion a sudden increase in the demand for
labor—such as the establishment of a great new industry
or the opening up of new territory by the completion
of a railroad or recurring “good times” after a
period of depression. If this new demand must perforce
be met by the labor already in the country, there
would be an opportunity for an increase in wages to the
working man. But the condition which actually confronts
the American workman at such a time is this—not
only is the amount of wages which can be successfully
demanded by labor profoundly influenced by the
number and grade of foreign workers already in the country,
but there comes at once, in response to improved
conditions, a sudden and enormous increase in the volume
of immigration. Thus the potential advantage which
might accrue to the laborers already in the country is
wholly neutralized. The fluctuating nature of the immigration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>current is of vital importance to the American
workman. It means that for him the problem is not that
of taking the fullest advantage of a possibility of an improved
standard, but of maintaining intact the standard
which he has. We have seen that, in the long run, the
only way in which he can do this is by limiting the
size of his family.</p>

<p class='c010'>The familiar argument that the immigrants simply
force the native laborers up into higher positions is often
urged in this connection. It is hard to see how any
one can seriously hold this opinion. The fallacy of it
has already been shown. It is, of course, perfectly
obvious that at the present time most of the native
workmen in industry are in the better paid positions,
and that the lower grades are occupied by foreigners.
But the question is, are there as many native workmen
in high positions as there would have been in all positions
if there had been no immigration? This is what the
“forcing up” argument assumes, and the falsity of the
position seems self-evident. It appears much more
reasonable to believe that while a few native workers
have been forced up, a vastly larger number are working
side by side with the immigrants and earning approximately
the same wages—to say nothing of that other
body of native labor which the immigrants have prevented
from ever being brought into existence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even if it were true that the native American himself
is as well off as he would have been without immigration,
that would not settle the matter. The question is that
of the standard of living of the American workman. If
the American workman happens to be a foreigner, it is
just as important for the welfare of the nation, and of
humanity, that he be properly housed, fed, clothed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>educated, and amused as if he were a native. We
would still have to face the fact of a standard continually
retarded by accessions of newcomers, representing ever
lower economic strata. Can we afford, as a nation, to
allow the standard of living of the workman, whoever
he is, to suffer in this way?</p>

<p class='c010'>It appears that the forces whose working has been
outlined in the preceding paragraphs can have only one
logical outcome—namely, the depression of the wage
scale of the American workman. If immigration has
not absolutely lowered the wages and the standard of
living of the American workman, it certainly has kept
them from rising to the level that they otherwise would
have reached. This is the opinion reached by many of
the most careful students of immigration in the country,
and it seems the only tenable one.<a id='r276'></a><a href='#f276' class='c018'><sup>[276]</sup></a> And after all, this
is the really important thing. For it must not be forgotten
that poverty, and riches, and standards of living
are all purely relative terms. It is not a question of
how much a man has, absolutely, as of how much he has
in comparison with those around him, or how much he
might have had. So that the common statement that
the American workman of to-day has more of the comforts
and luxuries of life than one in the same class fifty
or one hundred years ago, by no means meets the case.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>If his share in the wonderful prosperity of the nation has
not increased at least in the same proportion as that of
the capitalist, or the professional man, or other members
of society, then he has really suffered loss.</p>

<p class='c010'>Immigration has seriously complicated the problems
of the trade-unions in this country. Both the need and
the difficulty of organization have been greatly increased.
The traditional attitude of the unions toward immigration
has been one of opposition. Restrictive measures,
in particular the contract labor law, have met with their
approval and support. But when the immigrants are
once admitted to the country, the unions are under the
necessity of either receiving them or suffering from their
competition. A large body of unskilled laborers, with
low standards, unaffiliated with the unions, is most
prejudicial to the success of unionism. Alien races differ
as to their adaptability to union control. Some of the
races of southeastern Europe are looked upon as natural
strike-breakers. The Irish, on the other hand, are natural
organizers, and at the present time tend to monopolize
the direction of the unions. In some cases a large
influx of foreigners has practically put the unions out of
the running.<a id='r277'></a><a href='#f277' class='c018'><sup>[277]</sup></a> In others, the unions come to be made up
largely of foreigners. At times it is necessary to organize
the different racial elements into separate subgroups.<a id='r278'></a><a href='#f278' class='c018'><sup>[278]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>On the other hand, the unions exercise a great educative
influence on the immigrants—often practically the
only one with which the adult foreigner comes in contact.
They encourage him to learn English, imbue him
with higher standards of living, and teach him the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>principles of independent thought and self-government.<a id='r279'></a><a href='#f279' class='c018'><sup>[279]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>One of the chief objections to unrestricted immigration
has always been the belief that it seriously increased
the amount of pauperism and crime in the country, and
added to the burden of relief and correction. We have
seen how large a part this objection played in the early
opposition to immigration, not only in colonial days,
but during the first half of the nineteenth century.
Even in our day, in spite of the laws prohibiting the
entrance of criminals, paupers, and persons likely to become
a public charge, there is a widespread impression
that these two evils are increased through immigration.</p>

<p class='c010'>The prominence of pauperism as an item in the immigration
agitation has led to the production of a large
amount of material on the subject. Nevertheless,
most of it has been fragmentary and untrustworthy.
This has been largely due to the incompleteness and
lack of uniformity of the records of various eleemosynary
institutions, and the difficulty of securing returns
from all the manifold agencies of relief. At the present
time, however, as a result of careful studies by the Immigration
Commission, this is one of the very few effects
of immigration about which we may feel justified in
setting down definite conclusions.</p>

<p class='c010'>According to statistics for the year 1850 a native-born
population of 21,947,274 contributed 66,434 of the paupers
who were wholly or partially supported in the country,
while a foreign-born population of 2,244,602 contributed
68,538.<a id='r280'></a><a href='#f280' class='c018'><sup>[280]</sup></a> This was manifestly enough to arouse deep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>consternation, and had not the current of immigration
fallen off in the latter fifties we should probably have had
a pauper restriction clause in the federal statutes long
before we did. The enactment and enforcement of
such a statute has prevented the recurrence of any such
state of affairs in recent years. Nevertheless, as one
glances at random over the reports of various charitable
organizations he is impressed with the fact that the
number of foreign-born paupers is out of all proportion
to the total number of foreign-born inhabitants.
Thus in Massachusetts in 1895 a foreign-born population
of 30.6 per cent furnished 47.1 per cent of the

<p class='c010'>These figures are the most authoritative and inclusive
which there are, covering the almshouses of the country,
and show a ratio of paupers among the foreign-born
vastly in excess of the ratio of total population.</p>

<p class='c010'>The paupers in almshouses, however, do not by any
means include the total number of persons who belong
in that category. There are large numbers of persons
receiving relief, who never get inside the almshouses.
To cover this class, the Immigration Commission made a
special study of immigrants as charity seekers, which
included the work done by the charity organization
societies in forty-three cities, during the six months from
December 1, 1908, to May 31, 1909. The cities were distributed
as follows: North Atlantic states, 17; North
Central states, 18; Southern states, 4; Western states, 4.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the terminology of this report, a “case” means an
individual or family assisted. The head of the case is the
husband, if he is living at home, or the wife if widowed or
deserted. If there are no parents or real family, the
one upon whom the responsibility falls is the head of
the case, or otherwise, the one asking assistance. The
total number of cases for which information was secured
is 31,685. Of these, the head of the case was foreign-born
in 38.3 per cent of the cases, native-born of foreign
father in 10.7 per cent, native-born white of native
father, 39.9 per cent, and native-born of native negro
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>father, 11 per cent. Of the persons represented, 37.5 per
cent were native white of native father, and 42.3 per
cent foreign-born. For exact conclusions, comparison
should be made of the relation of the percentage of
foreign-born paupers to the percentage of foreign-born
in the total population in each separate city. For general
purposes it is sufficient to note that in the cities of 25,000
or over in 1910—which include all of the forty-three
cities studied—the percentages of foreign-born were 20.2
for cities of 25,000 to 100,000, 22.1 for cities of 100,000
to 500,000, and 33.6 for cities of 500,000 and over.<a id='r285'></a><a href='#f285' class='c018'><sup>[285]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In fifteen out of the forty-three cities one half or more
of the cases, classed by the head of the case, were foreign-born,
Milwaukee standing at the head of the list with
67 per cent. In twelve out of the forty-three cities,
more than 15 per cent of the cases were immigrants of the
second generation, Milwaukee again standing at the
head with 25.5 per cent. These two classes make up 92.5
per cent of all the cases for this city. There is evidently
more than one thing that makes Milwaukee famous, with
a possible connection between them.</p>

<p class='c010'>In regard to the relative importance of the various
foreign races in this respect, we find that the Germans
show the largest proportion, amounting to 6.8 per cent
of the total number of cases and 7.1 per cent of the total
number of persons. The next in order are the Polish,
with 6.5 per cent of the cases and 8.6 per cent of the persons,
and the Irish, with 6.2 per cent of the cases, and
6.3 per cent of the persons.</p>

<p class='c010'>As might be expected, the proportion of foreign-born
is much larger (more than half) in the cities of the North
Atlantic states than in the rest of the country, and very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>small (10 per cent) in the southern cities. It is interesting
to see how each city has its special problem. For
instance, in Buffalo 32 per cent of all the cases were
foreign-born Poles, and in Chicago 20 per cent were of
the same class. In Hartford 15.1 per cent of the cases
were foreign-born Irish, in Lynn 10.7 per cent were
foreign-born Canadians (other than French), and 19.3
per cent foreign-born Irish. In Milwaukee 33.3 per
cent were German, in Newport 22.2 per cent were Irish,
in Orange 26.4 per cent Irish, in Rochester 14.6 per cent
south Italian, in San Francisco 23.7 per cent were “other
races.” By way of comparison, it is interesting to note
that in Washington 56.9 per cent of the cases were native-born
negroes of native father. In ten of the cities, the
native-born whites of native father were less than one
fourth of the cases.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Hebrews are noted for looking after their own poor,
yet in six cities more than 5 per cent of all the cases were
foreign-born Hebrews. In Brooklyn they made up 18.1
per cent, and in Malden 15.7 per cent. The Germans
rank first among the foreign races in 18 cities, and tie
with other races in three more. The Irish rank first in
nine cities and tie with the Germans in one more. The
Polish rank first in four cities and tie in one more.</p>

<p class='c010'>One more piece of evidence may be taken from the
Report of the Commissioner General of Immigration for
1908 (p. 98). It is there shown that in the charitable
institutions (other than for the insane) in the United
States, including Alaska, Hawaii, and Porto Rico, both
public and private, there were, at the time this investigation
was made, 288,395 inmates, of whom 19,572 were
aliens, 40,453 naturalized citizens, and 228,370 native-born.
The percentages are native-born 79.2 per cent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>and foreign-born 20.8 per cent. It appears that the
proportion of foreign-born in institutions is not so extremely
excessive as among those seeking a more temporary
relief. This is what might be expected in the
light of certain considerations respecting the make-up
of the foreign-born group which are now to be considered.</p>

<p class='c010'>It thus becomes evident that from whatever source the
figures are taken, the percentage of foreign-born dependents
is sadly out of proportion to their relative number
in the general population. The absolute figures themselves
are bad enough. But a further consideration of
the composition of the foreign-born element will demonstrate
that the actual showing is much worse than the
figures would indicate on their face.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have seen that as respects their economic efficiency
the immigrants are a picked group. The same is true
of the foreign-born in the country. This is especially
evident as regards the age distribution. The following
table, taken from the census of 1910, illustrates this point:</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>It will be seen that there is a much larger proportion
of the foreign-born in the middle age groups, that is, in
the period of greatest productivity, than of the native-born.
There ought accordingly to be a smaller percentage
of pauperism, rather than a larger one.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sex distribution contributes a further element to
this disparity. In 1910, in the native-born white population
there were 102.7 males to 100 females. In the
foreign-born white population there were 129.2 males to
100 females. This should lessen the liability of the
foreign-born to pauperism.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another factor which enters in to complicate statistical
comparisons of pauperism among immigrants and native-born
is the matter of the age at which persons become
dependent, or, in the case of the immigrants, the number
of years they have resided in the United States before
they become dependent. There are two periods at
which the immigrant is most likely to need relief. The
first is immediately after landing, when he has exhausted
his slender store of money, and has not yet found means
of self-support. Seven per cent of the entire Jewish
immigration to the United States, in one year, found it
necessary to apply at the office of the United Hebrew
Charities in New York, within a short time after their
arrival. Relief granted at this time is liable to be temporary,
and the immigrant cannot justly be considered a
pauper. If he actually becomes dependent, he is of
course liable to deportation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second, and vastly more important, period is
several years after arrival, when the immigrant has
exhausted the prime of his strength, and becomes one of
the unfit in the keen struggle for economic existence.
Those who become dependent at this time are likely to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>remain so for life. They are those who have been unable
or unwilling to make provision for old age, perhaps being
so dazzled by the apparent richness of America that they
gave no thought to a possible future dearth, perhaps
having sent all their meager savings year by year back
to friends or relatives in the old country, possibly never
having been able to earn more than a bare living wage.
Individuals of this class make up the vast majority of the
foreign-born paupers in our almshouses. The census of
1890 showed that 92 per cent of the foreign-born male
paupers in the almshouses of the United States had been in
this country ten years or more. The corresponding figures
for the twelfth census show that out of 27,230 foreign-born
paupers whose length of residence in this country
is known, 26,171, or 96 per cent, had been here ten years
or more.<a id='r287'></a><a href='#f287' class='c018'><sup>[287]</sup></a> The facts furnished by the investigation of the
Immigration Commission in respect to persons aided by
the Charity Organization societies are similar; it must be
borne in mind, also, in respect to these cases, that they
largely represent instances of temporary distress, rather
than settled dependence. Of all the foreign-born heads of
cases aided by these societies, 44 per cent had been in
the United States twenty years or more, and 70.7 per cent
ten years or more. When it is recollected how small a proportion
of our foreign-born population have been in this
country twenty years or over, or even ten years or over,
it is manifest how misleading are comparisons in respect to
pauperism between native-born and foreign-born, based on
the total population of the two classes. Thus, according
to the census of 1910, only 62.2 per cent of the total foreign-born
population, and 60.2 per cent of the foreign-born
population in the urban communities, had immigrated in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>the year 1900 or earlier.<a id='r288'></a><a href='#f288' class='c018'><sup>[288]</sup></a> These facts also point to a possible
great increase of pauperism among the foreign-born,
as the average length of residence of this class increases.</p>

<p class='c010'>The age of admission to the almshouse of the different
population groups gives corroborative evidence along
the same line. The following figures, taken from the
census report on Paupers in Almshouses (p. 129), give
the average age at admission of the different groups in
1904: native white of native parentage, 45.6 years;
native white of foreign parentage, 41.7 years; native
white of mixed parentage, 38.3 years; foreign-born
white, 56.9 years. The high average age of the foreign-born
is due in part to the relatively small number of
foreign-born children in the country. But it is undoubtedly
also an indication of the effectiveness of the
system of examination in weeding out those whose liability
to dependence in the near future can be detected. It furthermore
adds to the apprehension with which we must
look forward to the time when a greater proportion of our
foreign-born residents will be above the specified age.</p>

<p class='c010'>These considerations have an especial bearing on the
effort to establish the relative tendency toward dependence
of the different immigrating races. As one runs
over tables of dependence or pauperism, arranged by
nationality, he is impressed by the immense preponderance
of the Germans and Irish among those listed. His
first conclusion is likely to be that the popular idea of the
greater desirability of these races over the newer immigrants
is an error; but as soon as he recalls how much
longer these races have been in this country, on the average,
than the southeastern Europeans, he realizes that
these tables, taken by themselves, are wholly unreliable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>as indicating relative tendencies among races. The
following table will serve as an illustration:</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Taking these figures as they stand, we may say roughly
that the Irish have thirty times as many paupers as
those born in Russia and Poland, and forty-six times as
many as the natives of Italy or Hungary and Bohemia,
and twice as many as the Germans. But this evidently
does not represent the relative tendencies to pauperism
of these races. The first correction to be made is in
regard to the relative numbers of each group in the total
population. The Irish have 3.3 times as large a total
population as the Italians, which reduces the ratio of
relative tendency to pauperism down to about fourteen
to one. By a similar reckoning we find that the Germans
manifest only about one third the tendency to pauperism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>that the Irish do, but 4.2 times as great as the Italians.
But before even approximately accurate figures for the
relative tendencies of these races can be secured, a further
correction must be made for the relative average length
of residence of the different groups. This unfortunately
cannot be done in the present state of our information.</p>

<p class='c010'>The figures in the preceding paragraph are of course
merely the rudest approximations, but they serve to
convey an idea of the extreme complexity of the problem
of determining relative tendencies toward pauperism,
and illustrate the utter worthlessness of the ordinary
hit-and-miss comparisons which are made.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Immigration Commission also made a study of the
patients admitted to Bellevue and Allied Hospitals for the
seven months period August 1, 1908, to February 28, 1909.
The total number of charity patients or cases was 23,758.
Of these 18.5 per cent were native-born of native father
(2.5 per cent negro), 28.5 per cent native-born of foreign
father, and 52.3 per cent foreign-born. The Irish foreign-born
are far in the lead, having approximately one fifth
of all the cases treated. If we add the Irish native-born
of foreign father, we have over one third of the total.</p>

States, the two danger periods noted above are well

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>The same distinction appears here between the old and
new immigrants that we should expect—a high percentage
for the old immigrants in the group over twenty,
and a high percentage for the new immigrants in the
group under five.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whether the newer races, as their average length of
residence in this country increases, will approach the
degree of pauperism of the Irish and Germans, time alone
can tell. The strictness of the tests of admission to the
United States has steadily increased, and this has had
the effect of giving the later immigrants a better showing,
as a body, than the earlier ones. It is not impossible
that time will prove that thrift and foresight are more
distinguishing features of the southern races than of the
northern, purchased though they are at the cost of a
very low standard of living. A large amount of relief is
undoubtedly sought by members of the newer races of
immigrants. Among the Charity Organization cases
studied by the Immigration Commission, 14.2 per cent
of the Russian foreign-born heads of cases had been in the
United States less than one year, and the following percentages
of foreign-born heads of cases had been in the
United States less than five years: Magyar, 44.1 per
cent; Russian, 38.7 per cent; Italian, south, 26.6
per cent; Syrian, 25.8 per cent; Italian, north, 25.6 per
cent. The races having the largest percentages of
foreign-born heads of cases residing in the United States
twenty years or over were: Irish, 71.3 per cent; Welsh,
70.4 per cent; French, 62.9 per cent; German, 62.8 per
cent; Canadian, French, 58.5 per cent.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Hebrews exhibit a large amount of dependence,
but as they are almost wholly looked after by their own
race they seldom appear in large numbers in the public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>reports. The United Hebrew Charities of New York,
in the year 1904, received 10,334 applications at their
relief bureau, representing 43,938 individuals, and expended
for relief alone $124,694.45. In 1912 the number
of applications had fallen to 7140, representing 31,835
individuals, but the expenditure for relief had risen to
$254,188.71. This indicates, as the report points out,
that the present applicants are in need of permanent
relief to a much greater extent than those of a decade
ago. The report of the same organization for
October 1, 1901, gives the estimate that from 75,000
to 100,000 Jews in New York alone are not self-supporting.</p>

<p class='c010'>There can be but one conclusion from the foregoing
discussion, namely, that our foreign-born residents add
to the burden of public and private relief an amount
largely out of proportion to their relative numbers in the
general population, and that this burden is likely to be an
increasing one. Mr. Prescott F. Hall publishes an estimate
that the total annual cost of caring for the foreign-born
poor of New York State alone equals $12,000,000.<a id='r290'></a><a href='#f290' class='c018'><sup>[290]</sup></a>
It is worth noting that while the expense of this burden
of relief is borne by the public and by benevolent individuals,
the real benefit goes to the employer of cheap
labor. He secures his labor at a wage which will barely
maintain its efficiency for a period of years, without any
provision for the future, and when that period is over,
and the laborer is no longer an efficient producer, he is
cast aside with absolutely no responsibility resting on
the employer for his future support or care.<a id='r291'></a><a href='#f291' class='c018'><sup>[291]</sup></a> At the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>customary rate of wages there seem to be but two alternatives
open to the workingman’s family—either to
live on a frightfully low standard, and make some slight
provision for the future, or to live on a somewhat higher
standard and run the risk of dependence in old age or
misfortune.<a id='r292'></a><a href='#f292' class='c018'><sup>[292]</sup></a> It is obvious that both of these are unqualifiedly
bad.</p>

<p class='c010'>As to the causes of this abnormal amount of pauperism
Miss K. H. Claghorn makes the following statement:
“While it is plain enough that foreign immigration has
some connection with the problem of pauperism since
common observation and all the statistics available unite
in showing that the majority of the recipients of our
charity, public and private, are of foreign birth, it is
equally certain on the other hand that pauperism is not
something that the immigrant brings with him, but is the
result of a considerable period of life and experiences
here.”<a id='r293'></a><a href='#f293' class='c018'><sup>[293]</sup></a> This opinion, coming from so high a source,
emphasizes two facts—first, that it is not altogether, if
at all, the immigrant’s “fault” that there is so much
pauperism among this class. Those who have been paupers
before, or seem likely to become so, are refused admission.
Second, that there is something radically
wrong in the industrial adjustment of the United States
when so large a number of foreigners, who come here
primarily for motives of financial betterment, and who
are not by nature thriftless, are unable during a long period
of faithful labor to lay up anything against the period
of helplessness. We cannot escape the accusing finger
which points toward the United States, demanding recognition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>of the fact that we are by no means prepared
to accept the tremendous responsibility of admitting
unlimited numbers of aliens whose entire future destiny
depends upon the soundness of our political, social, and
economic fabric.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may be worth while to note some of the general
causes which lead to pauperism among the foreign-born.
(1) Lack of intelligence. This is sometimes represented
by figures of illiteracy. This is hardly a fair basis of judgment,
however, as illiteracy may be often the result of
poor opportunity, rather than of low intelligence. Nevertheless
it is true that the average immigrant of the present
generation is probably inferior to the average native
workingman, and hence is handicapped in the competition
with him. (2) Lack of industrial training. Most of the
immigrants have had no training in their home countries
to fit them for higher industrial pursuits, and many of
those who have, find that it is not adapted to American
conditions. (3) Lack of foresight. This must not be
generally asserted of the immigrant class, for undoubtedly
a large proportion of them are well equipped with an
appreciation of the future. Yet in many cases, the ease
with which a comparatively comfortable living may be
secured in the first years of residence, and the apparently
inexhaustible riches of the United States, combine to
make the alien neglectful of a future period of dearth.
(4) Large families. The birth rate of the foreign-born is
a high one, and a large number of young children is always
a predisposing cause of pauperism in a struggling
family. In this connection some significant figures are
furnished by the investigation of the charity organization
cases, made by the Immigration Commission, and
already referred to. Of all the foreign-born male
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>persons, aided by these societies, who were twenty
years of age or over, 81.5 per cent were married, 5 per
cent deserted, separated, or widowed, and only 13.5 per
cent single. Of the females, 62.3 per cent were married,
33.9 per cent deserted, separated, or widowed, and only
3.8 per cent single. When we remember how much the
single men outnumber the married men in the general
population of the foreign-born above twenty years of age,
we see that if the time ever comes when immigration
becomes more of a family matter than at present—in
many ways a condition much to be desired—it must
inevitably bring with it a tremendous increase in the
amount of foreign-born pauperism. (5) Money sent
home. If the situation of the immigrant was such that
these large sums could be retained in this country, as a
reserve fund against future want, his liability to pauperism
would be much diminished. This, of course, cannot
be expected, since much of this money is sent back
to meet obligations which no one would wish the immigrant
to evade. In cases where it is sent back to support
a family, it is doubtless a more economical arrangement
than if the wife and children were maintained in the
United States. (6) Low wages, and the maladjustment
between the supply of labor and the demand. Enough
has already been said to establish this as a fundamental
condition, and it is the proximate cause of pauperism
in the majority of cases. The attempt to analyze and
classify the causes of pauperism is unsatisfactory at
best; yet a certain amount of light may be shed on the
subject in this way if carefully done. The Immigration
Commission’s Report on Immigrants as Charity Seekers
assigns the cases studied to certain general causes in the
following proportions:</p>

<div class='footnote c011' id='f294'>
<p class='c030'><a href='#r294'>294</a>. The total of per cents adds up to more than 100 as more than one cause is
often reported for the same case.</p>
</div>

<p class='c010'>There is no great difference in the proportions of the
different causes in the different general groups. It may
be significant to note that the per cent of cases due to the
neglect or bad habits of the breadwinner is a little larger
for the native-born white of native father than for the
foreign-born, and larger for the native-born white of
foreign father than for either. If we take persons instead
of cases, the showing of the native-born of foreign father
is even worse. The relatively small number of cases due
to this cause—the only one which may be charged
directly to the “fault” of the breadwinner—indicates
that the difficulty lies rather with the industrial system
of the United States than with the culpability of the
individual.</p>

<p class='c010'>That assimilation, in so far as it is represented by
ability to speak English, will not remedy the situation
is indicated by some suggestive figures given in the report
on Charity Seekers above quoted. It is shown
(p. 70) that of the total number of persons assisted, six
years of age or over, belonging to non-English speaking
races, 76.3 per cent were able to speak English. Now
in the report on Manufactures and Mining it appears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>that only 53.2 per cent of the foreign-born employees
studied, belonging to non-English speaking races, could
speak English. That is, the percentage of dependents,
who are so far “assimilated” as to be able to speak English,
is much greater than the percentage of those who are
at work, in spite of the fact that the former class includes
younger children than the latter. This harmonizes with
the fact already demonstrated, that dependent foreigners
have been in this country much longer than the average
of their group. It also lends color to the suggestion
made by a charity worker, that one reason why the newer
immigrants do not appear in larger numbers on the
books of philanthropic organizations is that they are
not yet “on to the ropes,” and that as they become
familiarized with American methods, they will seek
relief in increasing numbers.</p>

<p class='c010'>The subject of crime is customarily linked with that of
pauperism in the discussions of immigration, and the
same claim is frequently made, viz. that immigration has
increased the amount of crime in this country. The
attempts at proof of this assertion generally follow the
same method adopted in the case of pauperism, that is,
they consist in an examination of the relative tendency
toward criminality of the general groups of native-born
and foreign-born. In other words, the line of argument
is, if the foreign-born manifest a larger proportion of
criminals among their number than do the native-born,
all increases in the foreign-born population will mean a
more than proportional increase in crime for the country
as a whole. There is, however, another way in which
immigration might operate to increase crime. That is,
by interfering with the natural adjustment of economic
relations between different classes, it may so alter the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>condition of the native-born as to lead to an increase in
crime in this class. For instance, it has been claimed that
a large proportion of the “hobo” class (who are, to be
sure, not necessarily criminal) are native Americans who
have been forced out of employment by foreign competition.
In a similar way, other individuals may have
been driven into active crime. This proposition, whatever
the incidental evidence for or against it, is manifestly
incapable of statistical proof, and for any semi-mathematical
demonstration we must rely on the other
method of approach.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the matter of crime the effort to make generalizations
is complicated by the fact that it is necessary to take
into account, not only the number of crimes, but the
nature and severity of the criminal act. Tests of criminality,
to be accurate, should include quality as well as
quantity. This is obviously very difficult to do. We
are accustomed in everyday phraseology to speak of one
crime as being worse than another. Presumably crimes
against the person are more serious than crimes against
property. In the case of crimes against property, we
might naturally consider it “worse” to steal $1000 than
$5, but it would not necessarily be so.</p>

<p class='c010'>These conditions frequently result in an injustice
to the immigrant. The police and court records of our
great cities show an amazing proportion of crimes chargeable
to the foreign population. For instance, out of
71,253 persons held for trial or summarily tried and
convicted in the Magistrates’ Courts of New York City
in 1907, only 30,261, or considerably less than half, were
born in the United States. But when these records are
studied more closely it becomes apparent that a large
share of the offenses of the foreign-born are violations of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>the city ordinances,—offenses which are comparatively
trivial in themselves do not indicate any special tendency
toward criminality, and are in many cases intimately
associated with a low station in life. The moral character
of alien groups may in this way be seriously misrepresented.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nevertheless, if comparisons are to be made at all,
they must rest upon such records as these, and such
allowances as are possible be made afterwards. Figures
of this kind are available in the publications of the Census
Bureau, the Commissioner General of Immigration, and
the Immigration Commission. In the census report on
Prisoners we find that of the prisoners enumerated in the
United States on June 30, 1904, 76.83 per cent were
native-born, and 23.7 per cent foreign-born. In the
general white population, ten years of age or over, in
1900, 80.5 per cent were native-born and 19.5 per cent
foreign-born. If a due allowance is made for a disproportionate
growth of the foreign-born population
between 1900 and 1904, the relative proportions of prisoners
among the two groups would be approximately
equal. Of the white prisoners of known nativity committed
during 1904 the percentages were as follows:</p>

</table>

<p class='c033'>The somewhat less favorable showing made by the foreign-born
in the case of those committed than of those enumerated,
is accounted for by the large proportion of minor
offenses among the foreign-born. Many minor offenders,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>serving short sentences, would not be included at all in
the enumeration. Over half the major offenders among
the foreign-born had been in the United States ten years
or more, and about two thirds of the minor offenders.</p>

<p class='c010'>According to the Report of the Commissioner General
of Immigration for 1908 (p. 98), there were in the penal
institutions of the United States, including Alaska,
Hawaii, and Porto Rico (in which the figures are not
large enough to affect the conclusions materially), in
1908, 149,897 inmates, of whom 15,323 were aliens,
8102 naturalized, and 126,562 native-born. Thus the
percentage of native-born was 84.4 and of foreign-born
15.6.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Immigration Commission made a careful study
of the matter of crime among the immigrants, reviewing
the foregoing data, and collecting some original data of
its own, covering 2206 convictions in the New York City
Court of General Sessions from October 1, 1908, to June
30, 1909. This is, so far as known to the Commission,
the first time that any court in the United States had
made a record of the race of persons convicted in it.
This fact illustrates the utter inadequacy of the data for
making any deductions as to the influence of immigration
upon crime in the United States. Not only courts,
but police departments and penal institutions, are very
lax in their keeping of records in this respect.</p>

<p class='c010'>In response to the questions, “Is the volume of crime
in the United States augmented by the presence among us
of the immigrant and his offspring?” and “If immigration
increases crime, what races are responsible for such
increase?” the Commission says that no satisfactory
answer has ever been made, or can ever be made, without
much more complete data than have ever been collected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>or are available. Certain general conclusions, however,
have been reached by the Commission, which harmonize
with those reached by other students, and are worthy
of acceptance as far as they go. First, “No satisfactory
evidence has yet been produced to show that immigration
has resulted in an increase in crime disproportionate
to the increase in adult population. Such comparable
statistics of crime and population as it has been possible
to obtain indicate that the immigrants are less prone to
commit crime than are native Americans.”<a id='r295'></a><a href='#f295' class='c018'><sup>[295]</sup></a> Second,
“Immigration has, however, made changes in the character
of crime in the United States.”<a id='r296'></a><a href='#f296' class='c018'><sup>[296]</sup></a> These changes
have been in the direction of an increase in offenses of
personal violence, and offenses against public policy
(disorderly conduct, drunkenness, violation of corporation
ordinances, etc.), some of which are incident to city
life, and probably in offenses against chastity. There
does not appear to have been any increase in the majority
of offenses against property, or, as they may be better
called, gainful offenses.<a id='r297'></a><a href='#f297' class='c018'><sup>[297]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Comparing the different races as regards criminality,
it appears that the Irish stand at the head as regards the
total number of offenses and the Germans next. In
respect to major offenses, however, the Germans stand
first, while the Irish again take first place in the minor
offenses.<a id='r298'></a><a href='#f298' class='c018'><sup>[298]</sup></a> The Germans are much addicted to crimes
against property, the Irish and Scotch to drunkenness,
Greeks and natives of Russia to violations of corporation
ordinances, and immigrants from France, Russia, Poland,
and Canada to crimes against chastity. The Italians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>are preëminent in crimes of violence or crimes against
the person.<a id='r299'></a><a href='#f299' class='c018'><sup>[299]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>It is even more difficult to postulate the causes of
crime than of pauperism. Until the criminologists have
furnished us with a more efficient means of determining
the causes of crime in general, there can be no profit in the
attempt to classify the causes of crime among a particular
group of the population. In respect to the nature of
crime committed by different races, there seems to be
something in the racial character of some of our immigrants
which predisposes them in a certain direction, as
exemplified in the preceding paragraph. There is also
evidence that among some of the newer immigrants,
crime is largely a matter of economic position. This is
well illustrated by the case of the Greeks. Among the
members of this very recent immigrant group, there has
been a noteworthy decline in the average of criminality
within the last few years, and the explanation appears to
be that the crimes of the Greeks are such as correspond
with a low economic situation—violations of corporation
ordinances, of the sanitary code, etc. As a larger
and larger proportion of the individuals of this nationality
rise above this lowly estate, the percentage of crime
among them falls off correspondingly.<a id='r300'></a><a href='#f300' class='c018'><sup>[300]</sup></a> This emphasizes
once more the responsibility of the United States
for some of the evil conditions for which we habitually
blame the immigrants.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are two particular forms of crime which are
closely associated with foreign groups in the United
States. These are the Black Hand outrages and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>white slave traffic. The former of these is confined
almost wholly to persons of the Italian race. In some of
its features it recalls the Molly Maguire occurrences of a
generation earlier. In fact, the resemblance between the
Irish societies and the Mafia of southern Italy was noted
in a contemporary magazine article at the time of the
disturbances in the anthracite region of Pennsylvania.<a id='r301'></a><a href='#f301' class='c018'><sup>[301]</sup></a>
In both cases no organic connection between the societies
in the new world and the old is manifest. In fact, the
best judgment in regard to the Black Hand appears to
be that there is no real organization in existence in America,
but that individuals of Italian race use the power of
the dreaded name to accomplish their own ends. Like
the Molly Maguires, the Black Hand operators utilize
warning letters, but they differ from them in that their
purpose is often, if not usually, blackmail, which was
seldom the case with the Irish society.</p>

<p class='c010'>The white slave traffic has aroused tremendous public
interest during the last few years, and has been thoroughly
exploited in the daily and periodical press. Only the
essential features, particularly in their bearing on immigration,
need to be reviewed in the present connection.
Not all of the girls concerned in this business are immigrants,
nor are all the persons who draw a revenue from
it foreigners; yet the various investigations of the subject
have demonstrated that the whole trade is fundamentally
an affair of our foreign population.</p>

<p class='c010'>One surprising thing about this traffic is that essentially
it is an economic phenomenon. It is not a perverted
sex passion which demands the perpetuation of the inhuman
system; it is the desire for large and easy profits,
and the life of indolence that goes with them, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>actuates the promoters of the traffic, while on the part of
the alien women it is frequently the desire for larger
earnings which brings them to our shores. The demand
has to be stimulated.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are two classes of these alien girls who are brought
over. One consists of innocent girls who are brought
over under a false understanding. The incentive is
usually a false promise of employment or of marriage.
Sometimes false marriages, and occasionally actual
marriages, are resorted to. With this class of subjects,
the male importer is naturally the most successful. All
kinds of inducements are offered by the procurer, including
an apparently sincere love-making. About the
only inducements which female importers can offer
to such girls are easier or more lucrative employment.
The other class, probably constituting a large majority,
are women who have already been leading an immoral
life on the other side, and come in the hope of bettering
their prospects, although they recognize the power of the
importer.</p>

<p class='c010'>These women and girls are usually brought over second
class, and every conceivable artifice is employed to deceive
the inspectors. When a girl has been safely introduced
into the country, she is completely in the power
of the man who controls her. The supposition is that
the man furnishes protection and care to the girl in
return for her earnings. She is sometimes kept in a disorderly
house, sometimes in a hotel or other resort, but
always where the man can keep control of her. She is
thoroughly frightened, and every device is employed to
keep her from communicating with any outside sources
of relief, or escaping. She is often deprived of street
clothing, so as to make escape impossible. She is kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>heavily in debt, so that there may be a legal claim over
her. Only a very small part of her earnings is given
to her, and she is charged outrageous prices for all the
supplies which are furnished her. Her life is one of
hopeless and terrible degradation, and she has nothing
to look forward to except a wretched and continually
descending existence, and an early death.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alien women are particularly desirable to the promoters
of this traffic because their lack of connections in
this country, and their ignorance of the language and
customs of the country make it more difficult for them
to escape or to make trouble for their men than in the
case of native girls. In addition to the terrible wrongs
wrought upon the women themselves, this practice has
resulted in an increase in the number of prostitutes in
the United States, in the introduction and dissemination
of dangerous diseases, and in the introduction of various
forms of unnatural vice, more degrading and terrible
than even prostitution itself in its ordinary form.</p>

<p class='c010'>The great majority of the alien women found by the
Immigration Commission engaged in these pursuits, as
well as the men who prosecute the traffic, are French and
Hebrews. Belgians are largely engaged in it, according
to Commissioner Bingham. Germans are numerous, and
there are a few Irish and Italians, with of course a scattering
of individuals of other races.</p>

<p class='c010'>A number of these women are detected at the port of
entry and returned, and a good many are deported.
But it is a practice very difficult of detection, and it is
not easy to get at the facts in regard to its extent in this
country. It is certain that the class of abandoned
women in this country is largely recruited in this way.
Commissioner Bingham estimated in 1908 that there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>were more than 100,000 such women on the Pacific coast
and in Mexico, who had come in through New York.</p>

<p class='c010'>No evidence has been found to justify the suspicion
that there was an organization controlling this traffic in
this country. But those engaged in the trade naturally
are acquainted with each other, and are always ready to
help each other against a common enemy. They have
various meeting places where they get together for gambling,
conference, and divers forms of recreation.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has been proven that this traffic is slavery in more
than name, as girls are sometimes sold directly by one
person to another. The new federal law is designed to
put a check to all practices of this sort, by making it
illegal to transport women or girls from one state to another
for immoral purposes. The efforts of the Immigration
Commission and other governmental agencies within
the last two or three years have accomplished a good
deal in breaking up some of the resorts, and deporting or
imprisoning the culprits. But while the traffic has received
a serious setback, it is by no means killed. This
is emphatically one of the things where eternal vigilance
is the price of safety. Nothing short of a sweeping
change in public opinion and practice will ever put it
out of the way beyond the possibility of resurrection.<a id='r302'></a><a href='#f302' class='c018'><sup>[302]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In respect to juvenile delinquency the most unenviable
place is held by the native-born children of immigrants.
They not only manifest two or three times as great a
tendency toward crime as the native-born children of
native parents, but they are much more criminal than
foreign-born children. Of the juvenile delinquents committed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>during 1904, according to the census report,
76.7 per cent were native white. This percentage was
made up as follows: native parentage, 37.6 per cent;
foreign parentage, 24.9 per cent; mixed parentage,
9.7 percent; parentage unknown, 4.5 per cent. An
exact comparison of the children of native parents and
of foreign parents in this respect would require information
as to the total number of the two classes in the
country in the year in question, which is not available.
But it cannot be supposed that the number of native-born
children of foreign parents compared with the number
of native-born children of native parents is anything
like the ratio shown in the above figures. This high
degree of criminality is attributed by Professor Commons
and by the Immigration Commission largely to concentration
in the cities. Whatever the cause, this tendency
toward lawlessness among the second generation of
immigrants is indisputable, and is one of the most disturbing
elements in the whole situation.<a id='r303'></a><a href='#f303' class='c018'><sup>[303]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Still another way in which the immigrant becomes a
burden upon the American public is through insanity.
The laws are very strict in regard to the admission of
aliens who are liable to be subject to this misfortune.
Yet it is impossible to prevent the entrance of large numbers
who ultimately appear in the category of the insane.
The maladaptation of the immigrant to his environment
shows itself in this way perhaps as clearly as in any
other.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the institutions for the insane, both public and
private, in the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>and Porto Rico, in 1908, there were, according to the
Report of the Commissioner General of Immigration,
172,185 inmates. Of these 25,066 were aliens, 25,128
naturalized citizens, and 121,451 native-born. Thus
the percentages were 70.5 per cent native-born and
29.5 per cent—nearly one third—foreign-born.<a id='r304'></a><a href='#f304' class='c018'><sup>[304]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>An even larger percentage of foreign-born appears
among the insane persons enumerated in hospitals in
continental United States on December 31, 1903—34.3
per cent of the white insane of known nativity<a id='r305'></a><a href='#f305' class='c018'><sup>[305]</sup></a>—while
of the persons received at Bellevue and Allied Hospitals
for treatment for insanity during the period
of the investigation of the Immigration Commission,
63.4 per cent were foreign-born, and 36.6 per cent native-born.
Moreover, among the native-born, more than
half (20.6 per cent of the total) were native-born of
foreign father.</p>

<p class='c010'>Summing up the matter of insanity, the Commission
speaks as follows: “For the high ratio of insanity among
the foreign-born, several causes have been assigned, and
while it is difficult to determine the values of the various
factors it is probably true that racial traits or tendencies
have a more or less important influence. A further cause
of mental disease is probably to be found in the total
change in climate, occupation, and habits of life which
the majority of immigrants experience after arrival in
the United States.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The efficiency of the inspection in regard to feeble-mindedness
is shown by the very small proportion of
foreign-born of that class appearing in the statistics.
This is an affliction which can more easily be detected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>than the liability to insanity, of which there may be no
observable indication at the time of admission.<a id='r306'></a><a href='#f306' class='c018'><sup>[306]</sup></a></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XVI<br> <span class='c017'>INDUSTRIAL EFFECTS. CRISES. SOCIAL STRATIFICATION. POLITICAL EFFECTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It has been observed already that the great argument
for immigration during the past half century has been the
economic one. The main defense for immigration has
rested upon the claim that it has decidedly increased the
industrial efficiency of the American people, and has
facilitated the development of our resources, and the
expansion of industry, at a rate which would not have
been possible otherwise. The facts in regard to the age,
sex, and physical soundness of the immigrants are mustered
to establish them as a peculiarly efficient industrial
body.</p>

<p class='c010'>This contention rests upon two assumptions. First,
that our alien residents constitute a net addition to the
total population of the country; second, that if there
had been no immigration, and the population, particularly
that part of it which constitutes the labor supply, had
been smaller, that there would have been no inventions
and improvements in the way of labor-saving machinery
which would have permitted the same amount of work
to be accomplished with a smaller amount of labor.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the light of what has been said in regard to the relation
between immigration and the growth of population
in Chapter XI, the first of these claims, at the very
least, is open to serious question. While the proposition,
as has already been stated, is absolutely incapable of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>mathematical proof, there nevertheless is every reason to
believe that our immigrants have not meant a gain in
the labor supply, but the substitution of one labor element
for another. Not only have the immigrants in
general displaced the natives, but the newer immigrants
have displaced the older ones in a wide variety of industries
and occupations. This latter process has gone
on before our very eyes; it is manifest and perfectly
comprehensible. A careful consideration of it may make
it easier to understand how the same result, in a more
subtle way, has been accomplished in the case of the
native-born.</p>

<p class='c010'>The displacement of the English, Irish, Welsh, and
German miners in the anthracite region of Pennsylvania
by Italians and Slavs is a familiar fact.<a id='r307'></a><a href='#f307' class='c018'><sup>[307]</sup></a> The Italians
are being driven out of the boot-blacking business, and
other of their characteristic trades, by the Greeks. The
Irish laborers on the railroads have been largely supplanted
by Italians, Slavs, and Greeks. The “Bravas,”
or black Portuguese, have forced the Poles, Italians, and,
in large measure, the Finns from the cranberry bogs of
Massachusetts.<a id='r308'></a><a href='#f308' class='c018'><sup>[308]</sup></a> Granite City and Madison, Illinois,
have witnessed a succession of English, Irish, German,
Welsh and Polish, Slovak and Magyar, Roumanian,
Greek, and Servian, Bulgarian and Armenian laborers
in their industries.<a id='r309'></a><a href='#f309' class='c018'><sup>[309]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In these cases it is plain that while some of the displaced
individuals have gone into other, very likely
higher, occupations, the real substitution has been the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>concomitant of a cessation of immigration from the older
sources. The north Europeans, being unwilling to meet
the competition of races industrially inferior to them,
have either ceased emigrating in large numbers, or else
are going elsewhere. At any rate they do not come here.
The diminution of the supply of native labor has been
brought about in an analogous way, though in this case
the restrictive forces operate upon the principles of
reproduction instead of immigration.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even though it be granted that the numerical supply of
labor has been somewhat increased, there has been an
undeniable decrease in the efficiency of the individual
laborer, as is attested by the uniformly superior earnings
received by the native-born as compared with the foreign-born,
or the old immigrant as compared with the new.
As Dr. Peter Roberts has pointed out,<a id='r310'></a><a href='#f310' class='c018'><sup>[310]</sup></a> there seems to be
a sort of Gresham’s law which operates in the field of
labor. The fittest to survive in an unregulated economic
competition of races is the one least advanced in culture,
the one whose demands in respect to comforts and decencies
are lowest, even the one, it sometimes seems,
whose industrial productiveness per individual is lowest.
It is this fact which gives so dark an aspect to the industrial
future of the United States under unregulated
immigration.<a id='r311'></a><a href='#f311' class='c018'><sup>[311]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In regard to the second assumption—that a smaller
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>labor supply would not have been offset by an increase in
invention—we are again confronted with an impossibility
of proof, one way or the other. The economists tell
us that one of the great incentives to invention is a
scarcity of labor, and also that many of the greatest inventions
have been made by men who are working daily
with machines, and consequently are in a position to
discover improvements that may be made. There is at
least some reasonable basis for the belief that if the
absence of immigration to this country had resulted in a
smaller laboring force, the greater pressure on employers
to secure machinery, and the greater intelligence
of the machine worker, would together have brought
about such a betterment of labor-saving machinery as
would have resulted in a total production equal to what
we have actually witnessed.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is inconceivable that in America, of all countries,
any needed work should have to be neglected because of
the lack of a foreign labor element, or because of a shortage
of labor in general.<a id='r312'></a><a href='#f312' class='c018'><sup>[312]</sup></a> It is hard to see how in a nation
the majority of whose citizens are healthy and intelligent
there can be any real shortage of labor. What there
can be, is a shortage of labor <i>at a given wage</i>. In a prosperous
community there may be industries into which a
sufficient number of laborers will not go, at the wages
which the promoters are originally willing to pay. But
if there is an actual social need for those industries,
wages will rise to a point high enough to attract a sufficient
number of workers, however irksome or disagreeable
the employment. No self-respecting community
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>ought to expect industries to be carried on within its
borders for which it is not willing to pay such a price as
will enable the workers to subsist in reasonable comfort
and decency. If there are any industries carried on
in the United States which, in the absence of a foreign
labor supply, would have to be abandoned, because the
native-born laborers or their children would refuse to
go into them, it simply means that society is not yet
ready to pay a fit price for the products of those
industries.</p>

<p class='c010'>This brings us to the question of the effect of immigration
on the amount and distribution of wealth in the
United States. It is frequently pointed out that we
receive yearly a net increase of half a million or so of
able-bodied laborers, for whose upbringing and education
we, as a nation, have expended nothing. It is
stated that it is cheaper to import laborers than to raise
them. The truth of this assertion depends first of all
on the quality of the laborer. It may be cheaper in the
long run to rear laborers of the American type than to
import Portuguese, Russians, and East Indians. Furthermore,
while we do not pay directly for the laborers, we
pay a great deal for their residence in this country.
The estimated amount of money sent abroad by aliens in
1907, $275,000,000, is probably higher than the total
for an average year. Suppose $200,000,000 be taken as
an average amount.<a id='r313'></a><a href='#f313' class='c018'><sup>[313]</sup></a> These remittances do not represent
commercial payments for imports, but are savings actually
withdrawn from the wealth of this country and sent
abroad to be expended there. So that for each able-bodied
alien laborer who enters the country something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>like $400 goes out. In a sense a good deal of this
money might be considered as actual payment for the
importation of the laborers, since much of it goes for
traveling expenses, debts incurred to provide for emigration,
etc.<a id='r314'></a><a href='#f314' class='c018'><sup>[314]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Whether immigration has increased either the total or
per capita wealth of the nation may be open to question.
One thing, however, is certain—it has profoundly
affected the distribution of wealth in the country. It
has been sufficiently demonstrated that the successive
waves of immigration have represented an ever cheapening
labor supply. As the country has grown in wealth
and prosperity the employers of labor have found that
they could secure their workers at relatively, if not
absolutely, lower rates decade after decade. Whenever
conditions became such that the native laboring force,
if left to themselves, might have successfully demanded
better conditions or higher remuneration, there has
appeared an inexhaustible supply of foreign laborers,
ready and willing to take what was unsatisfactory to the
natives, or less. The workman already in the country,
whether native or foreign, has been continually robbed of
his advantage. Thus the gap between capital and labor,
between the rich and the poor, has grown ever wider.
Not only have wages been kept from rising, but conditions
of labor have persisted and been tolerated which an
American laboring force would never have submitted to.
The accounts of terrible accidents in mines and foundries
arouse sincere feelings of sympathy in our breasts for the
poor foreigners who have to suffer so. They would incite
a storm of indignant protest which would not be stilled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>until remedies were provided, if those who are subjected
to such conditions were our own kin brothers.<a id='r315'></a><a href='#f315' class='c018'><sup>[315]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>There is still another characteristic feature of our
economic life, between which and the immigration movement
a close and peculiar connection can be traced.
This is the frequent recurrence of economic depressions,
or crises. The causal relation between these events and
the variations in the volume of the immigration current
has already been mentioned. There is also a causal
relation between these conditions and the fluctuations
in the outgoing stream of aliens. This fact has received
no little attention of late years, and it has been frequently
pointed out that a period of depression in this country is
followed by a large exodus of the foreign-born.</p>

<p class='c010'>The popular interpretation of this fact is that this
emigration movement serves to mitigate the evils of the
crisis by removing a large part of the surplus laborers,
until returning prosperity creates a demand for them
again. The Italian, who displays the greatest mobility
in this regard, has been called the safety valve of our labor
market. Thus the movements of our alien population
are supposed to be an alleviating force as regards crises.</p>

<p class='c010'>The question arises, however, in this connection,
whether there is not a converse causal relation; in other
words, whether the conditions of immigration are not,
partly responsible for the recurrence of these periods.
Professor Commons takes this view of the matter, and
in his book, <cite>Races and Immigrants in America</cite>, demonstrates
how immigration, instead of helping matters,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>is really one of the causes of crises. His conclusion is that
“immigration intensifies this fatal cycle of ‘booms’ and
‘depressions,’” and “instead of increasing the production
of wealth by a steady, healthful growth, joins with
other causes to stimulate the feverish overproduction,
with its inevitable collapse, that has characterized the
industry of America more than that of any other
country.”<a id='r316'></a><a href='#f316' class='c018'><sup>[316]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The few pages which Professor Commons devotes to
this topic are highly suggestive, and show careful study
of the subject. The author, however, at the time this
book was written, was handicapped by the lack of data
regarding the departures of aliens, which, as we have
seen, have since become available. The fact that within
the period since the collection of these figures began, the
United States has experienced, and recovered from, a
severe depression, makes the study of this matter at the
present time particularly profitable.</p>

<p class='c010'>First of all, it will be desirable to see just what the facts
of immigration and emigration during this period are;
then we shall be prepared to attempt their interpretation.
The accompanying table (p. 349) gives the number of
aliens admitted to and departed from the United States,
and the net increase or decrease of population resulting
therefrom, by months, from January, 1907, to December,
1910 (with the exception of the figures of departures for
the first six months of 1907, which are not available).</p>

<p class='c010'>The figures for arrivals given in this table include both
immigrant and nonimmigrant aliens, a distinction which
has been observed with some care since 1906. The
column of departures also includes emigrant and nonemigrant
aliens.<a id='r317'></a><a href='#f317' class='c018'><sup>[317]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>It is not necessary to take account of these discriminations
for the purposes of the present study.</p>

<p class='c010'>Turning then to the table, we observe that the monthly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>average of arrivals during the first six months of 1907
was a high one. Following a large immigration during
the last six months of the preceding year, this made the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1907, the record year for immigration
in the history of the country. For the next
four months the stream of immigration continued high,
considering the season, and the number of departures
was moderate. Early in October, however, there were
signs of disturbance in the New York Stock Exchange.
On the sixteenth there was a crash in the market, and
within a week the panic had become general. It reached
its height on October 24, and continued for many weeks
after.<a id='r318'></a><a href='#f318' class='c018'><sup>[318]</sup></a> The response of the alien population to this disturbance
was almost immediate, and manifested itself
first in the emigration movement. In November the
number of departures almost doubled. But the immigrants
who were on the way could not be stopped, and in
spite of the large exodus, there was a net gain of 38,207
during the month. The next month, December, however,
saw a marked decrease in the stream of arrivals, which,
accompanied by a departure of aliens almost as great as in
November, resulted in a net decrease in population of
11,325 for the month. During the first six months of
1908 the number of arrivals was small, and the departures
numerous, so that, with the exception of March, each
month shows a net loss in population. During July the
number of departures began to approach the normal
(compare the months in 1908 with 1907 and 1910), but
the arrivals were so few that there was still a decrease
for the months of July and August. In September, 1908,
the balance swung the other way, and from that time to
the present every month with the exception of December,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>1911, has shown a substantial increase in population
through the movement of aliens.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus we see that the period during which the number
of alien laborers in the United States was decreasing was
confined to the months December, 1907, to August, 1908,
inclusive.<a id='r319'></a><a href='#f319' class='c018'><sup>[319]</sup></a> By the end of July, 1908, the effects of the
crisis were practically over as far as departures are concerned.
It is evident, then, that the effects of the crisis
on emigration were immediate, but not of very long
duration. During the months of November and December,
1907, when the distress was the keenest, there
were still large numbers of aliens arriving. But when
the stream of immigration was once checked, it remained
low for some time, and it was not until about January,
1909, that it returned to what may be considered a normal
figure. The reasons for this are obvious. The
stream of immigration is a long one, and its sources are
remote. It takes a long time for retarding influences in
America to be thoroughly felt on the other side. The
principal agency in checking immigration at its source is
the returning immigrant himself, who brings personal
information of the unfortunate conditions in the United
States. This takes some time. But when the potential
immigrants are once discouraged as to the outlook
across the ocean, they require some positive assurance of
better times before they will start out again.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now what catches the public eye in such an epoch as
this is the large number of departures. We are accustomed
to immense numbers of arrivals and we think little
about that side of it. But heavy emigration is a phenomenon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>and accordingly we hear much about how
acceptably our alien population serves to accommodate
the supply of labor to the demand. But if we stop to
add up the monthly figures, we find that for the entire
period after the crisis of 1907, when emigration exceeded
immigration, the total decrease in alien population was
only 124,124—scarcely equal to the immigration of a
single month during a fairly busy season. This figure is
almost infinitesimal compared to the total mass of the
American working people, or to the amount of unemployment
at a normal time, to say nothing of a crisis.<a id='r320'></a><a href='#f320' class='c018'><sup>[320]</sup></a>
It is thus evident that the importance of our alien population
as an alleviating force at the time of a crisis has
been vastly exaggerated. The most that can be said
for it is that it has a very trifling palliative effect.</p>

<p class='c010'>The really important relation between immigration and
crises is much less conspicuous but much more far-reaching.
It rests upon the nature and underlying causes of
crises in this country. These are fairly well understood
at the present time. A typical crisis may be said to be
caused by speculative overproduction, or overspeculative
production. Some prefer to call the trouble underconsumption,
which is much the same thing looked at
from another point of view. Professor Irving Fisher has
furnished a convenient and logical outline of the ordinary
course of affairs.<a id='r321'></a><a href='#f321' class='c018'><sup>[321]</sup></a> In a normal business period some slight
disturbance, such as an increase in the quantity of gold,
causes prices to rise. A rise in prices is accompanied by
increased profits for business men, because the rate of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>interest on the borrowed capital which they use in their
business fails to increase at a corresponding ratio. If
prices are rising at the rate of two per cent annually, a
nominal rate of interest of six per cent is equivalent to an
actual rate of only about four per cent. Hence, doing
business on borrowed capital becomes very profitable,
and there is an increased demand for loans.</p>

<p class='c010'>This results in an increase of the deposit currency,
which is accompanied by a further rise in prices. The
nominal rate of interest rises somewhat, but not sufficiently,
and prices tend to outstrip it still further. Thus
the process is repeated, until the large profits of business
lead to a disproportionate production of goods for anticipated
future demand, and a vast overextension of credit.
But this cycle cannot repeat itself indefinitely. Though
the rate of interest rises tardily, it rises progressively, and
eventually catches up with the rise in prices, owing to the
necessity which banks feel of maintaining a reasonable
ratio between loans and reserves. Other causes operate
with this to produce the same result. The consequence
is that business men find themselves unable to renew their
loans at the old rate, and hence some of them are unable
to meet their obligations, and fail. The failure of a few
firms dispels the atmosphere of public confidence which
is essential to extended credit. Creditors begin to demand
cash payment for their loans; there is a growing
demand for currency; the rate of interest soars; and the
old familiar symptoms of a panic appear. In this entire
process the blame falls, according to Professor Fisher,
primarily upon the failure of the rate of interest to rise
promptly in proportion to the rise in prices. If the forces
which give inertia to the rate of interest were removed, so
that the rate of interest would fluctuate readily with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>prices, the great temptation to expand business unduly
during a period of rising prices would be removed. It
may well be conceived that there are other factors,
besides the discrepancy between the nominal and real
rates of interest, that give to business a temporary or
specious profitableness, and tend to encourage speculative
overproduction. But the influence of the rate of interest
resembles so closely that resulting from immigration,
that Professor Fisher’s explanation is of especial service
in the present discussion.</p>

<p class='c010'>The rate of interest represents the payment which the
entrepreneur makes for one of the great factors of production—capital.
The failure of this remuneration to
keep pace with the price of commodities in general leads
to excessive profits and overproduction. The payment
which the entrepreneur makes for one of the other factors
of production—labor—is represented by wages. If
wages fail to rise along with prices, the effect on business,
while not strictly analogous, is very similar to that produced
by the slowly rising rate of interest. The entrepreneur
is relieved of the necessity of sharing any of his
excessive profits with labor, just as in the other case he is
relieved from sharing them with capital. It would probably
be hard to prove that the increased demand for
labor results in further raising prices in general, as an increased
demand for capital results in raising prices by
increasing the deposit currency. But if the demand for
labor results in increasing the number of laborers in the
country, thereby increasing the demand for commodities,
it may very well result in raising the prices of commodities
as distinguished from labor, which is just as satisfactory
to the entrepreneur. This is exactly what is accomplished
when unlimited immigration is allowed. As soon as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>conditions of business produce an increased demand for
labor, this demand is met by an increased number of
laborers, produced by immigration.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the preceding paragraph it has been assumed that
wages do not rise with prices. The great question is, is
this true? This is a question very difficult of answer.
There is a very general impression that during the last
few years prices have seriously outstripped wages.
Thus Professor Ely says, “Wages do not usually rise as
rapidly as prices in periods of business expansion.”<a id='r322'></a><a href='#f322' class='c018'><sup>[322]</sup></a>
R. B. Brinsmade stated in a discussion at a recent meeting
of the American Economic Association that “our
recent great rise of prices is acknowledged to be equivalent
to a marked reduction in general wages.”<a id='r323'></a><a href='#f323' class='c018'><sup>[323]</sup></a> Whether
this idea is correct, and if correct, whether this effect had
transpired in the years immediately previous to 1907,
cannot be definitely stated. The index numbers of
wages and prices given in the <cite>Statistical Abstract of the
United States</cite>, for 1909 (p. 249), seem to show that during
the years 1895 to 1907 money wages increased about
<i>pari passu</i> with the retail prices of food, so that the
purchasing power of the full-time weekly earnings remained
nearly constant.</p>

<p class='c010'>But whether or not money wages rose as fast as prices
in the years from 1900 to 1907, one thing is certain, they
did not rise any faster. That is to say, if real wages did
not actually fall, they assuredly did not rise. But the
welfare of the country requires that, in the years when
business is moving toward a crisis, wages should rise;
not only money wages, but real wages. What is needed
is some check on the unwarranted activity of the entrepreneurs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>which will make them stop and consider whether
the apparently bright business outlook rests on sound and
permanent conditions, or is illusory and transient. If
their large profits are legitimate and enduring, they
should be forced to share a part of them with the laborer.
If not, the fact should be impressed upon them. We
have seen that the rate of interest fails to act as an
efficient check. Then the rate of wages should do it.
And if the entrepreneurs were compelled to rely on the
existing labor supply in their own country, the rate of
wages would do it. Business expands by increasing
the amount of labor utilized, as well as the amount of
capital. If the increased labor supply could be secured
only from the people already resident in the country,
the increased demand would have to express itself in an
increased wage, and the entrepreneur would be forced to
pause and reflect. But in the United States we have
adopted the opposite policy. In the vast peasant population
of Europe there is an inexhaustible reservoir of
labor, only waiting a signal from this side to enter the
labor market—to enter it, not with a demand for the
high wage that the business situation justifies, but ready
to take any wage that will be offered, just so it is a little
higher than the pittance to which they are accustomed at
home. And we allow them to come, without any restrictions
whatever as to numbers. Thus wages are kept from
rising, and immigration becomes a powerful factor, tending
to intensify and augment the unhealthy, oscillatory
character of our industrial life. It was not by mere
chance that the panic year of 1907 was the record year in
immigration.</p>

<p class='c010'>Against this point of view it may be argued that the
legitimate expansion of business in this country requires
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>the presence of the immigrant. But if business expansion
is legitimate and permanent, resting on lasting favorable
conditions, it will express itself in a high wage scale,
persisting over a long period of time. And the demand
so expressed will be met by an increase of native offspring,
whose parents are reaping the benefit of the high
standard of living. A permanent shortage of the labor
supply is as abhorrent to nature as a vacuum. Expansion
of any other kind than this ought to be hampered,
not gratified.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is one other way in which immigration, as it
exists at present, influences crises. In considering this,
it will be well to regard the crisis from the other point
of view—as a phenomenon of underconsumption.
Practically all production at the present day is to supply
an anticipated future demand. There can be no overproduction
unless the actual demand fails to equal that
anticipated. This is underconsumption. Now the
great mass of consumers in the United States is composed
of wage earners. Their consuming power depends upon
their wages. In so far as immigration lowers wages in
the United States, or prevents them from rising, it reduces
consuming power, and hence is favorable to the
recurrence of periods of underconsumption. It is not
probable, to be sure, that a high wage scale in itself
could prevent crises, as the entrepreneurs would base
their calculations on the corresponding consuming power,
just as they do at present. But a high wage scale carries
with it the possibility of saving, and an increase of accumulations
among the common people. It is estimated at
the present time that half of the industrial people of the
United States are unable to save anything.<a id='r324'></a><a href='#f324' class='c018'><sup>[324]</sup></a> This increase
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>in saving would almost inevitably have some
effect upon the results of crises, though it must be confessed
that it is very difficult to predict just what this
effect would be. One result that might naturally be
expected to follow would be that the laboring classes
would take the opportunity of the period of low prices
immediately following the crisis to invest some of their
savings in luxuries which hitherto they had not felt able
to afford. This would increase the demand for the goods
which manufacturers are eager to dispose of at almost
any price, and would thereby mitigate the evils of the
depressed market. It is probably true that the immigrant,
under the same conditions, will save more out of a
given wage than the native, so that it might seem that
an alien laboring body would have more surplus available
for use at the time of a crisis than a native class. But
the immigrant sends a very large proportion of his savings
to friends and relatives in the old country, or deposits
it in foreign institutions, so that it is not available at
such a time. Moreover, our laboring class is not as yet
wholly foreign, and the native has to share approximately
the same wage as the alien. Without the immense body
of alien labor, we should have a class of native workers
with a considerably higher wage scale, and a large
amount of savings accumulated in this country, and
available when needed.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the other hand, it may be argued that if the desire
to purchase goods in a depressed market should lead to a
large withdrawal of cash from savings banks and similar
institutions, it might tend to augment rather than alleviate
the evils of a money stringency. There seems to be
much force to this argument. Yet Mr. Streightoff tells
us that in a period of hard times the tendency is for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>poorer classes to increase their deposits, rather than
diminish them.<a id='r325'></a><a href='#f325' class='c018'><sup>[325]</sup></a> On the whole, it seems probable that a
large amount of accumulated savings in the hands of the
poorer classes would tend to have a steadying influence
on conditions at the time of a crisis, and that by preventing
this, as well as in other ways, immigration tends
to increase the evils of crises.</p>

<p class='c010'>In closing this discussion, it may be interesting to note
what are the elements in our alien population which respond
most readily to economic influences in this country,
and hence are mainly accountable for the influences we
have been considering. As stated above, the annual
reports of the Commissioner General of Immigration give
very complete data as to the make-up of the incoming and
outgoing streams by years. Thus in the fiscal year 1908
there were 782,870 immigrant aliens and 141,825 nonimmigrant
aliens admitted. Of the nonimmigrant
aliens, 86,570 were individuals whose country of last
permanent residence and of intended future residence
were both the United States; that is, they were alien
residents of this country who had been abroad for a
brief visit. These are the birds of passage in the strictest
sense, in which we shall use the term hereafter. In the
same year there was a total exodus of 714,828 aliens, of
whom 395,073 were emigrants and 319,755 nonemigrants.
The former class includes those who have made their
fortune in this country and are going home to spend it,
and those who have failed, and are going home broken
and discouraged—a very large number in this panic
year. The latter class includes aliens who have had a
permanent residence in the United States, but who are
going abroad to wait till the storm blows over, with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>expectation of returning again—true birds of passage
outward bound. There were 133,251 of these. The
balance were aliens in transit, and aliens who had been
in this country on a visit, or only for a short time. In
1909 there were 751,786 immigrant aliens and 192,449
nonimmigrant aliens. Of the nonimmigrants 138,680
were true birds of passage according to the above distinction—a
large number and almost exactly equal to
the number of departing birds of passage in the previous
year. The storm is over, and they have come back.
The departures in that year numbered 225,802 emigrant
and 174,590 nonemigrant aliens. These numbers
are considerably smaller than in the previous year, but
are still large, showing that the effects of the crisis were
still felt in the early part of this fiscal year. The number
of birds of passage among the nonemigrant aliens, 80,151,
is much smaller than in the previous year. In 1910 there
were 1,041,570 immigrant aliens and 156,467 nonimmigrant
aliens. In the latter class, the number of birds
of passage, 94,075, again approximated the corresponding
class among the departures of the previous year. The
departures in 1910 were 202,436 emigrant aliens and
177,982 nonemigrant aliens, of whom 89,754 were
birds of passage. This probably comes near to representing
the normal number of this class. A careful
study of these figures confirms the conclusion reached
above. While a crisis in this country does undoubtedly
increase the number of departing aliens, both emigrant
and nonemigrant, and eventually cuts down the number
of arrivals, the total effect is much smaller than is usually
supposed, and taken in connection with the fact that the
stream of arrivals is never wholly checked, the influence of
emigration in easing the labor market is absolutely trifling.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>Comparing the different races in regard to their readiness
to respond to changes in economic conditions, it
appears that the Italians stand easily at the head, and the
Slavs come second. In 1908, in the traffic between the
United States and Italy, there was a net loss in the population
of this country of 79,966; in 1909 a net gain of
94,806. In the traffic between this country and Austria-Hungary
there was a loss in 1908 of 5463; in 1909 a gain
of 48,763. In the traffic with the Russian Empire and
Finland there was a gain of 104,641 in 1908 and a gain of
94,806 in 1909. This shows how unique are the motives
and conditions which control the emigration from the
two latter countries. The emigrants from there, particularly
the Jews, come to this country to escape intolerable
conditions on the other side, not merely for the sake
of economic betterment. They prefer to endure anything
in this country, rather than to return to their old
home, even if they could.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hand in hand with the economic disparity caused by
immigration has come an increasing social stratification.<a id='r326'></a><a href='#f326' class='c018'><sup>[326]</sup></a>
This is based partly on wealth, partly on race. Already
certain occupations are regarded as the special province
of certain nationalities, and native parents recoil from
the prospect of having their children enter them to work
side by side with the aliens. Only the beginnings of these
changes are as yet manifest, and no one can foretell what
the outcome will be. But even the beginnings must give
us pause. There can be no more pernicious social classification
in a nation than one based on race. Distinctions
resting on wealth, religion, or education can be overcome,
potentially at least. Distinctions of birth affect only a
small proportion of a society, and exist only in nations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>long habituated to them. But distinctions of race
affect the entire population are fundamental, and can
never be obliterated except as assimilation is so perfect
that race is forgotten. No effort of the individual can
blot out his racial identification. The most familiar
example yet developed in the United States is that of the
Hebrews. However sincerely we may admire their fine
racial traits, however closely we may associate with individuals
of the race, we cannot deny that they constitute
a separate body in our population in many respects.<a id='r327'></a><a href='#f327' class='c018'><sup>[327]</sup></a>
Summer hotels are closed to them, or else other people
avoid those resorts. Americans move out of the sections
of cities where they are moving in. Select clubs are
closed to them. It is an indictment against the American
people that these things are so. We, who pose as the
friends of all races, however downtrodden and despised,
should be ready to take them into equality with us when
they seek refuge on our shores. Both Hebrews and
Americans may resent the bald statement of such facts.
Can we deny their truth?</p>

<p class='c010'>Nor is it only in high society, nor only among Americans,
that this friction is felt. In the slums of our cities bitter
feeling exists between the Italians and the Jews.<a id='r328'></a><a href='#f328' class='c018'><sup>[328]</sup></a> Nor
is racial antagonism confined to any two or three races.<a id='r329'></a><a href='#f329' class='c018'><sup>[329]</sup></a>
Employers of labor find it wholly expedient to arrange
their workers in groups of the same nationality.<a id='r330'></a><a href='#f330' class='c018'><sup>[330]</sup></a> Austria-Hungary
is an example of the conditions that may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>result when too many jarring nationalities are included
within a national territory. But the racial groups in
Austria-Hungary do not compare in diversity with those
which are gradually forming in the United States.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the political aspects of the immigration situation
there has been a peculiar reversal of public opinion in the
last three quarters of a century. In the days of the
Native Americans and the Know nothings, the uneasiness
was mainly due to the fear that too many aliens
would acquire the rights of citizenship. Then it was the
naturalized foreigner who was the undesirable. Nowadays,
the fear is that the foreigners will ignore the
privileges of citizenship, and a high percentage of naturalization
is a test of desirability in any foreign group.
This change may be attributed to a change in the situation
of the United States, and to a difference in the
character and causes of immigration. During the first
half of the nineteenth century the United States was
essentially a new country. Political questions were
predominant, and the memory of the men who fell in
the fight for freedom was still fresh in the minds of their
sons. The immigrants of the period, on the other hand,
were actuated to a large extent by the desire for political
freedom, and were keen to secure all the power possible
in this country. At the present time, the predominating
interests are wholly economic, and even the political
questions of the day have an economic flavor. At the
same time, the motives of the immigrants are almost
wholly economic. So the jealousy between native and
foreigner now concerns itself mainly with the industrial
relations, and anything which indicates an inclination on
the part of the alien to ally himself permanently with
the interests of the country is welcomed. The temporary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>immigrant was an almost unknown quantity in the
old days.</p>

<p class='c010'>The naturalization laws of the United States have
undergone only slight modifications in the past hundred
years.<a id='r331'></a><a href='#f331' class='c018'><sup>[331]</sup></a> The main provisions of the present laws are as
follows: In order to become a citizen of the United States
an alien must follow out the following method of procedure:
At least two years before he is admitted he must
file a preliminary declaration of intention. To do this
he must be at least eighteen years old. This declaration
shall state that it is his bona-fide intention to become a
citizen of the United States, and to renounce all other
allegiance to a foreign power, and shall set forth his
name, age, occupation, personal description, place of
birth, last foreign residence and allegiance, date of
arrival in the United States, name of the vessel, if any,
by which he came, and present place of residence in the
United States. Not less than two years nor more than
seven years after he has made application, he shall present
a petition in writing, signed in his own handwriting, stating
the essential facts about himself, including his declaration
of allegiance to the United States, and disclaiming
belief in anarchy, or belief in or practice of polygamy.</p>

<p class='c010'>This petition shall be verified by at least two credible
witnesses, who are citizens of the United States, who shall
state that they have known the applicant to be a resident
of the United States for a period of at least five years continuously,
and of the state or territory at least one year
immediately preceding, and that they have personal
knowledge of his good moral character and general fitness
to become a citizen of the United States.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>With this petition is filed a certificate from the Department
of Commerce and Labor, stating the date, place,
and manner of his arrival, and also his declaration of
intention. He shall swear in open court his allegiance
to the United States and renounce all other allegiance.</p>

<p class='c010'>In accordance with a recent law, no alien can now be
naturalized without an ability to speak the English
language, unless he has made entry upon the public
lands of the United States. No person may be naturalized
within thirty days preceding the holding of a
general election in the territorial jurisdiction of the court.
Chinese are not admissible to citizenship.</p>

<p class='c010'>A woman who is married to a citizen of the United
States is herself a citizen, provided she herself might be
legally naturalized. This provision has been the subject
of considerable attention lately on account of the
practice of women engaged in the white slave traffic
marrying a citizen in order to avoid deportation. The
Commissioner General in his report for 1910 recommended
that a more definite statement be made of this
clause, admitting of no doubt as to its interpretation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Children of naturalized citizens who were under the
age of twenty-one at the time of the naturalization of
their parents, if dwelling in the United States, are considered
citizens, as are children of citizens, born outside
of the United States.</p>

<p class='c010'>If any alien who has received a certificate of citizenship
shall, within five years thereafter, go to the land of
his nativity or to any other foreign country, and take up
permanent residence therein, it shall be deemed evidence
of his lack of intention to become a permanent citizen
of the United States at the time of filing his application,
and warrants the canceling of his certificate.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>According to the regulations of September 15, 1910,
clerks of courts are instructed not to receive declarations
of intention or file petitions for naturalization
from other aliens than white persons, and persons of
African nativity or of African descent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jurisdiction to naturalize aliens is conferred on the
following courts: United States circuit and district
courts in any state, United States district courts for the
territories, the supreme court of the District of Columbia,
and the United States courts for the Indian territory;
also all courts of record in any state or territory, having
a seal, a clerk, and jurisdiction in actions at law or
equity, or law and equity, in which the amount in controversy
is unlimited.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since the establishment of the division of naturalization
by the act of June 29, 1906, the business of naturalization
has been in the hands of the Bureau of
Immigration and Naturalization.</p>

<p class='c010'>The statistics of naturalization for the five years 1908–1912

<p class='c010'>In addition to the certificates granted there were, in
1912, 9635 certificates denied. These were for a variety
of causes, the most important of which was failure of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>the petitioners to prosecute them, so that they were
stricken from the docket. Of those which were actually
refused the largest single cause was incompetent
witnesses.</p>

<p class='c010'>There has been a large amount of fraud and trickery
in connection with naturalization, and presumably it has
not wholly ceased. This has been due partly to a lax
attitude on the part of some of the court officials, and
partly to the physical impossibility of giving proper
attention to the number of candidates who apply, with
the existing machinery. There is a story of one judge
in New York City who issued nearly seven thousand
papers in October, 1891, at the rate of two a minute.<a id='r333'></a><a href='#f333' class='c018'><sup>[333]</sup></a>
Many states have been very lax in their requirements for
voting. In some states aliens have been allowed to
vote in both state and federal elections, sometimes after
a residence of only six months.<a id='r334'></a><a href='#f334' class='c018'><sup>[334]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Even where naturalization is desired by recent immigrants,
it is not always for the most commendable
reasons. Sometimes the motive is the desire for a better
chance of securing employment,<a id='r335'></a><a href='#f335' class='c018'><sup>[335]</sup></a> sometimes the facilitating
of entrance into the United States after a trip abroad.
Natives of some foreign countries, particularly Turkey,
have come to the United States with the express intention
of securing citizenship, in order to return to their
native land, and carry on business under the protection
of the American flag, which carries with it greater
guarantees than their own. A special law, passed to put
a stop to such practices as these, provides that when a
naturalized alien has resided two years in the foreign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>state from which he came, or five years in any other foreign
state, he forfeits his citizenship.<a id='r336'></a><a href='#f336' class='c018'><sup>[336]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Of all foreign races, the Irish have taken by far the
largest place in politics in this country. According to
Professor Commons, the “ward boss” is the logical
product of the mixture of nationalities in the various
divisions of a city, and the Irishman is the logical man
for the work.<a id='r337'></a><a href='#f337' class='c018'><sup>[337]</sup></a> “The Irishman has above all races
the mixture of ingenuity, firmness, human sympathy,
comradeship, and daring that makes him the amalgamator
of races.”<a id='r338'></a><a href='#f338' class='c018'><sup>[338]</sup></a> Possibly a sense of humor ought to
be added to these qualifications. In the eyes of Professor
Commons, such a system makes it the merest
chance if the best man is elected, and subverts our
whole system of representative government.<a id='r339'></a><a href='#f339' class='c018'><sup>[339]</sup></a> It seems
beyond question that the existence of separate racial
groups in a community, each with its own prejudices
and group loyalty, must have a very disturbing influence
on the course of elections. Measures become of much
less import than men in the minds of the voters, and in
the choice of men race rather than fitness is often the
determining element.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XVII<br> <span class='c017'>THE NEW PROBLEM OF IMMIGRATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It was stated on an earlier page that the immigration
situation, in most of its important characteristics,
presents an entirely new aspect to the men of this generation,
and that these changes might be looked for under
six general heads, as follows: race, volume, distribution,
economic condition of the United States, native birth
rate and quality of the immigrants. We are now prepared
to consider the truth of this assertion.</p>

<p class='c010'>In regard to race, nothing further need be said. Sufficient
facts are already before the reader to establish the
fact that the racial aspect of the situation has undergone
a sweeping and significant change in the last thirty years.
The change in volume has naturally been one of degree,
not of kind. But the change in degree has been a profound
one—more so than is often admitted. It has
been pointed out occasionally, as a sedative to the fears
aroused by the immense immigration of the twentieth
century, that while the positive immigration has increased
tremendously, it has not increased at so great a
rate as the population of the country. The ratio between
immigration and total population was higher in
the early fifties and early eighties than at any subsequent
period. The assumption is that if we could successfully
assimilate the immigrants of the earlier period,
we certainly ought to be able to take care of those of
to-day. But the question of assimilation depends not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>only upon the ratio of immigrants to total population,
but upon the proportion of foreign-born population already
in the country. In this connection the following
figures are significant. The number of foreign-born
to 100,000, native-born in the population of the country
at the time of the last seven censuses was as follows:</p>

<table class='table2'>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'>1850</td>
    <td class='c027'>10,715</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'>1860</td>
    <td class='c027'>15,157</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'>1870</td>
    <td class='c027'>16,875</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'>1880</td>
    <td class='c027'>15,365</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'>1890</td>
    <td class='c027'>17,314</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'>1900</td>
    <td class='c027'>15,886</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'>1910</td>
    <td class='c027'>17,227</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c033'>It thus appears that the proportion of foreign-born,
even at the time of the census of 1900, after a decade of
very slight immigration, was much higher than at the time
of the beginning of large immigration, while the last census,
after the enormous immigration of the past ten years,
shows a proportion of foreign-born higher than at any
previous census, except that of 1890. Now it is the proportion
of foreign-born to native-born which determines
the assimilating power of the nation, so that without
this correction the comparison between immigration and
total population is inadequate and misleading. It is
as if a fireman whose steam boiler lacked a safety valve
was warned that his gauge was going up more and more
rapidly all the time, and he replied, “Never mind, the
pressure is not coming in so fast, compared to what I
already have, as it was awhile ago.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Another circumstance which affects the ability of the
country to assimilate immigrants, and in which there
has been a marked change during the history of immigration,
is the ratio of men to land, upon which much
emphasis has already been laid. As the amount of unappropriated
and unsettled land diminishes in any
country, the need of new settlers also diminishes, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>the difficulty of assimilation and the possible evils resulting
from foreign population proportionally increase.
In the case of the United States the first and simplest
comparison to make is that between immigration and
the total territory of the nation. In this, as in the subsequent
comparisons, it will be desirable to leave Alaska
out of consideration. The enormous extent of that
inhospitable region, to which practically none of our immigrants
ever find their way, if included in the reckoning,
would simply confuse the issue. The gross area of
the United States, exclusive of Alaska and Hawaii, at
the time of the different censuses, has been as follows:
1790 and 1800, 827,844 square miles; 1810, 1,999,775
square miles; 1820, 2,059,043 square miles; 1830 and
1840, the same; 1850, 2,980,959 square miles; 1860
down to the present, 3,025,600 square miles.<a id='r340'></a><a href='#f340' class='c018'><sup>[340]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Estimating the immigration before 1820 at 10,000 per
year, and using the official figures after that date, we
find that the immigration by decades from 1791 to 1910
was as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>This table illustrates forcibly the fact that from the
point of view of the need of new settlers immigration
at the present time is a vastly different matter from
what it has ever been before in the history of our
country. This impression is strengthened if we make
another comparison, which is even more significant for
our purposes, viz. the relation of immigration to the
public domain, that is, to the land which still remains
unclaimed and open to settlement. If there were still
large tracts of good land lying unutilized, and available
for settlement, as there have been in other periods of our
history, we could take comfort in the thought that as
soon as the incoming aliens caused too great a congestion
in any region, the surplus inhabitants would overflow, by
a natural process, into the less thickly settled districts.
Let us consider what the facts have to show in this
respect.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1860 there were, as nearly as can be estimated,
939,173,057 acres of land lying unappropriated and unreserved
in the public domain. In 1906 there were 424,202,732
acres of such land, representing the leavings,
after all the best land had been chosen. In other words,
for each immigrant entering the country during the
decade ending 1860 there were 374 acres in the public
domain, at least half of it extremely valuable farm land.
In 1906, for each immigrant entering during the previous
ten years, there were 68.9 acres, almost wholly
arid and worthless.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>The fact that the immigrants in this country do not,
to any great extent, take up this unclaimed public land
does not destroy the significance of this comparison.
As long as there was a strong movement of the native
population westward, it was not so much a matter of
concern, if large numbers of foreigners were entering the
Atlantic seaboard. And this was exactly the case
during the middle of the nineteenth century. This
was the period of the great internal migration to the
new lands of the Middle West. In point of fact also, at
this time, many of these pioneers were actually immigrants.
It is scarcely necessary to say that nothing
comparable to this is going on at the present time. The
frontier, which has had such a determining influence on
our national life, is a thing of the past. Of the 424,202,732
acres remaining in the public domain in 1906, only
a very small part consisted of valuable farm lands, such
as existed in great abundance when the Homestead Act
was passed in 1862. Evidence of this fact is furnished
by the act recently passed allowing homesteads of 640
acres to be taken up in certain sections of Nebraska,
where it is impossible for a man to make a living from
less. Not only are the incoming hordes of aliens not
now counterbalanced by an important internal migration,
but there is an actual movement, of noteworthy
dimensions, of ambitious young farmers from the United
States to the new and cheaper wheat lands in Canada.</p>

<p class='c010'>This set of conditions may be stated in another way by
saying that the United States has changed from an
agricultural to a manufacturing and commercial nation.<a id='r341'></a><a href='#f341' class='c018'><sup>[341]</sup></a>
In the early nineteenth century the rural family was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>typical one, to-day it is the urban family. Then the
simplicity and independence of the farm gave character
to the national life; to-day it is the complexity and artificiality
of the city which govern. The nineteenth
century was a period of expansion. Particularly in the
earlier part of it was the subduing of new land the fundamental
consideration of national development. This
was the period of internal improvements, the building
of roads and canals, and later of railroads. It was the
adolescence of the American people. At such a period
the great demand is for accessions of population, and it
is no wonder that many of the writers of that day were
frank in their demands for the encouragement of immigration.
And even in the thirties and forties, though
the miserable shipping conditions and the large number
of incoming paupers aroused a countercurrent of opinion,
still the immigrants found a logical place on the great
construction works of the period, as well as on the vacant
arable lands.</p>

<p class='c010'>This period is past. The labors of the typical alien
are not now expended on the railroad, the canal, or the
farm, but in the mines and foundries, the sweatshops
and factories. The immigrants of to-day are meeting
an economic demand radically different from that of a
century or half a century, yes, we may say a quarter of
a century ago.<a id='r342'></a><a href='#f342' class='c018'><sup>[342]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>This change is further exemplified by the increased
concentration of population in cities which the United
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>States has witnessed in the past century. In 1790
there were only 6 cities in the United States with over
8000 population each, containing 3.4 per cent of the
total population. In 1840 the percentage of population
in cities of this size was still only 8.4. But in 1900
there were 545 cities of over 8000, counting among
their inhabitants 33.1 per cent of the total population.
In other words, the ratio between city and country
dwellers (taking the city of 8000 as the dividing line)
has changed from one to twenty-eight in 1790 to
one to two in 1900. At the same time the average
density of population of the country as a whole has increased
from 3.7 per square mile in 1810 to 10.8 in 1860,
17.3 in 1880, and 25.6 in 1900.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hand in hand with these changes has come a sweeping
change in the scale of production, which must have an
important bearing on the immigration situation. The
early immigrants, to a very large extent, came into more
or less close personal relations with their employers,
often working side by side with them on the farm or in
the shop. Now foreigners are hired by the thousands
by employers whom they perhaps never see, certainly
never have any dealings with, the arrangements being
made through some underling, very likely a foreigner
himself. Working all day side by side with others of
their own race, or of other races equally foreign, and
going home at night to crowded dwellings, inhabited
by aliens, and with a European atmosphere, the modern
immigrants have but slight commerce with anything that
is calculated to inculcate American ideas or contribute
any real Americanizing influence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mention of the declining native birth rate in the United
States had already been made (Chapter XI), with some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>consideration of the causes thereof. The fact needs to
be called attention to in this connection as another element
in the changed aspect of immigration. It is unfortunate
that our census figures do not give us positive
data as to the respective birth rates of the native-born
and foreign-born, so that we have to rely upon estimates.
All of these estimates, however, agree that there has been
a marked decline in the rate of native increase, though
the causes assigned vary. The population of the United
States in 1810 was 1.84 times as great as in 1790, and
that of 1840, 1.77 times as great as twenty years earlier.
Since the immigration during all this period was relatively
slight, this increase may be taken as representing
a very high native birth rate. In 1900, in spite of
the large element of foreign-born with a high birth rate
then in the country, and the large immigration of the
previous twenty years, the population of the country was
only 1.52 times as large as in 1880. This must represent
a tremendous fall in the native birth rate. Mr. S. G.
Fisher has estimated that the rate of native increase by
decades has fallen from 33.76 per cent in the decade
ending 1820 to 24.53 in the decade ending 1890. Some
eminent authorities, as previously mentioned, are of the
opinion that at the present time the native population
of parts, if not the whole, of New England is not even
maintaining itself. Thus our present immigrants are
being received by, and are mingling with, a people, not
vigorous and prolific as in the early days, able to match
the crowds of aliens with a host of native-born offspring,
but weak in reproductive power, and constantly decreasing
in the ability to maintain itself. In this connection
it is significant that during the last intercensal
decade the total foreign-born population increased 30.7
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>per cent, while the native-born population increased only
19.5 per cent. This fact, in connection with the high
birth rate of our now large foreign-born population, puts
a new face on the question of the elimination of the
native stock.</p>

<p class='c010'>There yet remains to be considered the matter of the
quality of immigrants to-day as compared with those of
past generations. In regard to this but little can be
said in the way of positive declarations. Quality in an
immigrant is a very uncertain matter, and differs according
to the individual point of view and prejudices. What
may seem to an employer of labor high quality in an
immigrant may appear quite the reverse in the eyes of
a minister. With the facts of immigration in mind, each
student of the question must determine for himself
whether the quality of our present immigrants compares
favorably with that of earlier groups. There is,
however, one consideration to which attention should
be directed when examining changes, which has materially
altered the character of immigration. This is the
selective influence of the act of immigration itself, upon
those who are to come. It used to be the prevailing idea
that the immigrant represented the better individuals
of his race or class, that he was more daring, energetic,
or enterprising. Traces of this notion are still very
common.<a id='r343'></a><a href='#f343' class='c018'><sup>[343]</sup></a> There was, moreover, a great amount of
truth in this view during earlier periods of immigration.
Many of the migrations of two or three centuries ago
were inspired by religious or political motives, or very
often by a combination of the two. Such was the exodus
of the Huguenots from France, of the Palatines from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>Germany, the Puritans from England, the Scotch-Irish
from Ireland. In such cases as these, emigration implies
strength of character, independence, firmness of
conviction, moral courage, bravery, hatred of oppression,
etc. Motives such as these played no small part in
immigration movements even as late as the middle of
the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='c010'>More than this, it is doubtless true that the earliest
immigration from any region at any time involves a
certain degree of ambition, independence, courage,
energy, forethought, all of those characteristics which
are required in the individual who forsakes the known for
the unknown, the familiar for the untried, the stable for
the unstable, the certain though hopeless present for
the hopeful but uncertain future. Such were the early
immigrants to this country from every land—not north
European alone, but south European. They possessed
something of the intrepidity and daring of pioneers.
They had the strength of character to break the shackles
of age-long tradition and custom, and, taking their
destiny in their hand, seek their fortune in a new and
unknown land. In this respect all new immigration
differs from all established immigration.</p>

<p class='c010'>But all this is now a thing of the past. Not only have
the religious and political motives almost wholly disappeared
in favor of the economic in modern immigration,
but the European immigrant of to-day is in no sense
going to a new or unknown land, when he embarks for
the United States. American life and conditions, particularly
economic conditions, are well known in those
sections of Europe which furnish our large contingents of
immigration. The presidential election, the panic, the
state of the crops in the United States, are familiar topics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>of conversation.<a id='r344'></a><a href='#f344' class='c018'><sup>[344]</sup></a> Almost every individual in the established
currents of immigration has at least one friend
in this country. Many of them know exactly where
they are going and what they are going to do. To a
host of them the change is no greater than to go to the
next village in their native land, perhaps less so. For
as likely as not, just as many of their friends and relatives
are awaiting them in the new country as are lamenting
them in the old.</p>

<p class='c010'>Neither is the voyage to-day, bad as it is, beset with
the uncertainties, hardships, and perils which used to
characterize it. The way is cleared for the travelers
at every step. If their ticket is not actually supplied
to them from America, probably all or part of the money
with which it is purchased came from America. At
least they may now secure a ticket direct from a European
center to their ultimate destination in America, and
every stage of the journey is facilitated by the ingenuity
of financially interested agents. Induced immigration
has always existed since the days when the press gangs
in the coast towns of England carried inducement to the
point of abduction. But probably never in the history
of our country has artificially stimulated immigration
formed so large a part of the whole as now. There is
nothing, therefore, in the modern conditions of immigration
which serves as a guaranty of high quality in the
immigrants.</p>

<p class='c010'>One other element which concerns the quality of the
immigrant, and therefore should be mentioned in this
connection, is the immense increase in what may be
designated temporary or seasonal immigration. The
prominence of this type of movement in recent years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>has radically modified the industrial aspect of the
situation.<a id='r345'></a><a href='#f345' class='c018'><sup>[345]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>It is possible that some of the changes reviewed above
may be of a beneficial character. However that may
be, there can be no question that, taken together, they
indicate so complete an alteration in the circumstances
surrounding the admission of aliens to this country as to
require that the entire immigration situation be considered
in the light of present conditions, rather than of
past history. The old stock arguments, <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>,
which seem to have stood the test of time, need to
be thoroughly reviewed. The modern immigrant must
be viewed in the setting of to-day. Especially must it
be borne in mind that the fact—if such it be—that
immigration in the past has worked no injury to the
nation, and has resulted in good to the immigrants, by
no means indicates that a continuance of past policy
and practice in the matter will entail no serious evil consequences,
nor bring about disaster in the future.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XVIII<br> <span class='c017'>THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Much is said and written in these days about the
“immigration problem,” yet it is only rarely that there
appears a conscious effort to prove that such a problem
exists, or to analyze its character. Is there in the United
States an immigration problem? If so, in what does it
consist? To answer these two questions is the purpose
of the present chapter.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the great new lands of the Western Hemisphere
were made available to the inhabitants of Europe by the
efforts of Columbus and the later explorers and discoverers,
there opened up before humanity tremendous
possibilities of advance.<a id='r346'></a><a href='#f346' class='c018'><sup>[346]</sup></a> The ratio between men and
land was changed for the whole civilized world. An
enormous area of fertile country was presented to the
nations of Europe, by which the operation of the Malthusian
principles was checked. Peoples who had
reached the saturation point of population in Europe
were given the opportunity to utilize their acquired
arts in a virgin and practically uninhabited region. On
account of the difficulties of transportation, and the consequent
slow settlement of the new world, the results of
this great alteration were only tardily developed. In
many ways the entire progress of civilization during the
nineteenth century is the outward expression of the
transformation in conditions which then took place.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>So far as the human mind can anticipate, nothing of a
similar nature can ever happen again on this earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>To the people of the new nation of the United States,
as the possessors of the most favored portion of this new
territory, was intrusted the responsibility of utilizing its
marvelous resources, not only for their own advantage,
but for the securing of the greatest and most permanent
amelioration of the living conditions of the whole human
family. It was not to be expected that our forefathers
should have completely recognized the full significance
of this responsibility, nor have undertaken the administration
of it with a degree of scientific wisdom which
they did not possess. Their past experience of bad
political systems enabled them to frame a plan of government
which has held the admiration of all civilized
people down to the very present. In the utilization of
the material resources of the country, however, they
had no past experience to serve as a guide. No other
civilized people within the compass of human history
had been intrusted with such a profusion of virgin resources,
absolutely open to exploitation. There is no
wonder that the possibilities of the country seemed
limitless, and that men proceeded to make the most of
them to serve present needs, with no thought of what the
consequences might be to future generations. Forests
were cut down, mines were wastefully worked, rivers were
dammed, natural gas was burned day and night, the
soil was cultivated year after year without enrichment,
and when exhausted, abandoned. In our modern age of
conservation we are beginning to realize how ruthlessly
these rich treasures have been squandered, and are
making eager and earnest efforts to save what is left.</p>

<p class='c010'>Something of the same sort took place in the more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>intangible domain of population. Into the minds of
the less than four million people who were enumerated
in the United States in 1790, even the thought of a redundant
population could hardly enter. The one great
thing that seemed to be needed was more people, and
while the natural increase of the native stock seemed to
many ample to meet the demands, there was nevertheless
a hearty welcome to all sturdy and well-intentioned aliens
who elected to establish themselves within the territory
of the new nation. Especially was there a feeling of
sympathy toward those who came seeking refuge from
political tyranny or oppression in the nations of Europe.
Thus the principle of an open door, and a welcome to
the “oppressed and downtrodden of all races,” became
the established policy of the nation, and as decade
succeeded decade acquired all the power and authority
of tradition and usage. As a consequence, all efforts
to control or regulate the ingress of aliens, which have
been incited by the apparent needs of the situation, have
been confronted with the necessity of bearing the burden
of proof, and of assailing established dogma. This has
put the advocates of restriction into the category of
“antis,” and has laid them open to the charge of narrow-mindedness
and bigotry. If it can be conceived
that the United States should have been in her present
industrial situation when she first began to frame national
policies, it is wholly probable that the restrictionists
would have been considered the conservatives, and the
advocates of free immigration, the radicals.</p>

<p class='c010'>However this may be, the fact is that in general the
open-door policy has prevailed, and only within the last
generation have restrictive laws been passed, which
have served merely to weed out the manifestly undesirables,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>scarcely to diminish in any significant measure
the great bulk of the current. The resulting transfer
of people from Europe to America has been truly phenomenal.
In the period of years from 1820 to 1912
a total of 29,611,052 immigrants came to the United
States.<a id='r347'></a><a href='#f347' class='c018'><sup>[347]</sup></a> No population movement of equal social significance,
and comparable in volume, has ever taken
place within the recorded history of the human race.
And never again, so far as the human eye can see, can it
be repeated, when the heyday of immigration to the
United States is over. It is inconceivable that such a
phenomenon should not have important and far-reaching
effects upon every country concerned in the movement.
There is, then, an immigration problem.</p>

<p class='c010'>But just what is the problem? The answer to that
question depends upon the point of view. In the first
place, it must be decided whether it is desirable for
nations consciously to interfere with, and try to control,
such a natural movement as this; secondly, if interference
is to be undertaken, whose welfare is to be held
prominently in view—in other words, from what standpoint
is the problem to be attacked? If the former of
these queries is answered in the negative, the problem
remains a purely academic one—the study of causes
and effects, and the recording of conclusions and data,
without any telic purpose in view. No programs,
schemes, or systems of reform can emanate from such
a study. If answered in the affirmative, the problem
then becomes one in applied sociology—perhaps the
most complex and important that any modern nation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>has ever had to deal with. In regard to the second part
of the above query, it is to be noted that there are four
possible standpoints open to choice. First, that of the
United States; second, that of the countries of source;
third, that of the immigrants; fourth, that of humanity
in general. There are possibilities of a different aspect
of the problem from each of these viewpoints. Let us
consider the two parts of this query in turn.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is a natural and deep-seated reluctance on the
part of every careful and scientific student of sociology
to advocate the regulation of any great human activity
according to any man-made scheme or formula. The
laws of nature seem so much safer a guide than any plan
which, as Professor Summer says, some one has thought
out in bed.<a id='r348'></a><a href='#f348' class='c018'><sup>[348]</sup></a> The <i>laissez-faire</i> doctrine makes a great
initial appeal. This probably accounts in large measure
for its great vogue. The broad-minded and liberal man
says, “What can be better or more just than to let each
individual work out his own destiny in the way that
seems to him best?” Particularly does such a tremendous
movement as modern immigration inspire the
student with feelings of reverential awe, rather than a
desire to intermeddle. It is such a gigantic and complex
thing, and cuts straight across all social relations
with such an inclusive and unsparing sweep, that one
can never know what the unknown factors are, nor what
unforeseen and unexpected developments may arise.
Certainly this seems one of the things that had better
be left alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>But as we look at the world around us, we realize
that the doctrine of <i>laissez-faire</i> has proved inadequate
to meet the conditions of modern industrial life, and has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>broken down under the strain.<a id='r349'></a><a href='#f349' class='c018'><sup>[349]</sup></a> We realize that self-interest,
even enlightened self-interest, is not the safest
guide for the individual or for the race. We recognize
the fact that the safety of society demands that men
shall not be allowed to do as they please, nor to go where
they please. The law places many restrictions upon
the free movements of men. I may not trespass upon
my neighbor’s property; I may not enter public buildings
except at specified times. If I wish to visit a fever-stricken
and quarantined city, I either am not allowed
to go, or I am prevented from coming away when I wish.
These are familiar and trivial illustrations, but they
emphasize the fact that complete <i>laissez-faire</i> is impossible
under present conditions—in fact, probably
always has been. A host of other instances of social
legislation, pure-food laws, trust regulation, etc., might
be invoked to establish the point, were it necessary.
The whole series of immigration statutes, increasing in
severity from 1882 down to the present, are evidence of
the acceptance of this principle with special relation to
immigration. The question is not, shall we have regulation
or not, but how much and what kind of regulation
shall we have? The doctrine of <i>laissez-faire</i>, <i>per se</i>,
would have no greater weight as an argument against
complete suspension of immigration than it would have
against the exclusion of contract laborers.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the personal inclinations of the individual lead him
to prefer to regard the immigration problem in the
strictly academic light, no fault can be found; but the
denial of the propriety of suggesting plans of control,
the demand that the immigrants be let alone, represents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>an obsolete point of view. Any amount of regulation,
which proves necessary to safeguard the interests of
society, can be justified in the light of modern opinion
and practice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Furthermore, it is to be observed that immigration
will not be let alone. It has already been demonstrated
that the immigration of to-day is not in any sense a
wholly natural movement. It is stimulated at the outset,
partly by disinterested friends and relatives, partly
by purely selfish transportation interests. It is subjected
to various controls all along the way. After the
immigrants reach this country, they are often, for a long
time, in almost complete subjection to the padrone, the
contractor, or the importer. Once again, the question is
not, shall immigration be a natural and uncontrolled
movement or not, but shall it be controlled by greedy,
selfish, and unscrupulous individuals, or by a well-intentioned
government? For the rest of this book we
shall take the position that the immigration problem is
one of applied sociology, and that immigration is a
proper subject for government control, by such means
and to such an extent as the most careful and scientific
study shall warrant.</p>

<p class='c010'>Most problems in applied sociology have to do with
interests; certainly the problem of immigration does.
Having answered the first part of our query in the affirmative,
the problem now expresses itself thus: how
shall the movement of aliens from foreign countries to
the United States be so controlled as to further the best
interests of somebody? But of whom? This is the
second part of our query. It is manifest that the United
States, the countries of source, the immigrants, and
humanity in general all have interests which may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>affected by immigration, that these interests are not
always harmonious or correlative, but that they may be,
and in some cases must be, in direct opposition to each
other. Any one who has opinions on the subject must
make it plain, to himself at least, which of these interests
he regards as paramount, which of these standpoints he
proposes to assume. Many of the popular arguments on
the question have been confused by the unconscious
effort to take two or more of these viewpoints at once.
Each of these viewpoints is legitimate, and has arguments
on its own side, and no one should be blamed
for choosing any one. Evidently the fourth is a sort of
summation and balance of the other three. It will be
profitable to consider the first three in turn; we shall
then be prepared to take the point of view of the welfare
of humanity in general.</p>

<p class='c010'>What, then, are the arguments for and against immigration
from the point of view of the United States?
The positive arguments for, and the negative arguments
against, immigration center around the question whether
the United States needs the immigrants. The positive
arguments against, and the negative arguments for,
immigration have to do with the claim that immigration
injures the United States.</p>

<p class='c010'>The argument for immigration which, if not the
strongest during the first half of the nineteenth century,
was probably the most frequently expressed, was the
sentimental one which exhibited the United States as
the natural haven of refuge for the oppressed and unfortunate
of all lands, and extended a hearty welcome
to all seekers of liberty who should come. This, as
has been mentioned, was natural under the conditions
of the time. It found expression in such words
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>as the following, appearing in a magazine in the year
1855:</p>

<p class='c010'>“If the physiologic principle we have endeavored to
establish is correct, it follows that America pre-eminently
owes its growth and prosperity to the amalgamation of
foreign blood. To cut off, therefore, or to discourage
its influx, will be to check the current from which our
very life is drawn. The better course is evidently to
welcome and provide for this tide of immigration, rather
than to oppose and turn it away; to cherish the good influence
it brings, and regulate the bad, rather than to
trample them both under foot. What, though the population
which is annually cast upon American shores is
all of the filthiest and most degraded kind! The farmer
might as well complain of the black and reeking soil
into which his seed is dropped, as the statesman of such
materials as these.... Let us welcome the houseless
and the naked of every land to American shores; in
the boundless forests of the north and the south there is
room to make a home for them all. Let us invite the
ill-fed and the starving of every grade to partake of
American abundance; on the fertile fields of the west
there grows corn enough to feed them all. Let us urge
the oppressed and the down trodden of every name to
the blessings of American freedom; the Star Spangled
Banner is broad enough to cover, and the eagle that sits
over it is strong enough to defend, them all.”<a id='r350'></a><a href='#f350' class='c018'><sup>[350]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Such talk as this is so thoroughly out of date as to
sound almost ridiculous in modern ears. In fact, the
sentimental argument plays but little part in the present
agitation, for the reason that the conditions which justify
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>it furnish the motive to an insignificant portion of our
present immigrants, with the exception of the Russian
Jews.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two other arguments for immigration may be styled
the social and the biological. These claim respectively
that the national character and the physical stock of
the American people may be much improved by the
addition of new elements brought in by foreign immigrants.
It is pointed out that the German love for music,
the artistic temperament of the Italian, the thrift of the
Slav, the outdoor sociability of the Greek, might add—perhaps
have added already—something of great
value to the life of the country. There is much weight
to this argument. It is quite conceivable that under
proper conditions of social contact on a plane of equality
between foreigner and native some such desirable transfusion
of character might take place. It is another
matter altogether to claim that any such beneficial
result is transpiring, under the present conditions of the
immigrant in this country.</p>

<p class='c010'>The biological argument brings up the much-vexed
question of the desirability of mixed stocks. There has
been a prevalent opinion that the interbreeding of two
races, not too far separated in physical stock, resulted
in a type superior to either of the parent races. But
there is no agreement as to where the line between the
favorable and the unfavorable mixing shall be drawn.
Some of the papers read at the Universal Races Congress
in London would seem to convey the impression that
any two races on earth might be mixed to good advantage.
But this is by no means the universal opinion of careful
anthropologists.</p>

<p class='c010'>In regard to both of these arguments it may be said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>that, whatever their intrinsic worth, they have no great
positive weight as respects the present situation in the
United States. It seems likely that this country has
already within its borders all the alien elements that will
be needed for a long time to come—certainly until
they are more completely absorbed than they are at
present.</p>

<p class='c010'>There remains by far the greatest and most universal
argument for immigration—the economic one. The
one plea for the free admission of aliens, that has weight
to-day, is that our industrial organization demands it.
Not only is it asserted that the rapid development of
the country would not have been possible without the
immigrant and cannot be prosecuted in the future without
him, but that the cessation of immigration would
seriously cripple many of the basic industries of this
country. The former of these points has already been
considered at some length, and the conclusion was
reached that it was inconceivable that in such a country
as the United States any socially important or necessary
work should have had to be foregone in the absence of a
foreign labor supply. Such an assertion implies a lack
of self-sufficiency on the part of a young and vigorous
people which is unthinkable. Whether the exploitation
of our resources would have proceeded at such a rapid
pace in the past, whether this pace could be kept up in
the future, without the immigrant—these are questions
more difficult of answer. There is no doubt that at
present a large portion of our industry—possibly the
greater part—is closely dependent upon a foreign labor
supply, and that a sudden cessation of immigration would
check the expansion of those industries, though it would
not necessarily prevent their continuing on the present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>basis. It seems wholly probable that the development
of the country would be retarded for a time if the immigration
current was stopped.</p>

<p class='c010'>But why this insistent demand for a rapid exploitation
of our resources? Wherein are we the gainers if the
wonderful natural riches of the country, which, as we
have seen, constitute one of the two great elements
which have accounted for our past prosperity, are consumed
in the shortest possible time? In the words of
Prescott F. Hall, “what boots an extended railroad
mileage or the fact that all our coal and minerals are
dug up or all our trees cut down some years or decades
sooner?” Are we so greedy for luxury in the present
that we wish to leave as little as possible of this natural
advantage to future generations? It seems hardly
possible. Rather is this idea another of those traditional
survivals from the early life of the country, when conditions
were such that the exploitation of resources
was really essential to growth in per capita, as well as
total, wealth, and prosperity. Our country has, in
point of fact, developed so rapidly that the public mind
has not adjusted itself to new conditions, and the idea
of the value of a rapid exploitation lingers on as an
anachronism. Possibly there is a slight element of
modern megalomania mingled with it.</p>

<p class='c010'>If it were true that the United States, having reached
its present point of development, was unable to advance
along the path of steady and solid growth, depending
solely upon its own resources, human as well as material,
it would be one of the most serious indictments against
our social situation that could possibly be made. It is
inconceivable that it should be true. It seems much
more reasonable to believe that while the suspension of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>accessions of population from foreign sources would entail
numerous and serious readjustments in social and
economic relations, nevertheless the United States still
has enough native virility to work out a prosperous and
independent destiny of its own. It is hard to see any
important respect in which the United States, at the
present time, really needs immigrants.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is still another type of argument for immigration,
which might be called the indifference argument,
which says, in effect, “Very likely we do not need the
immigrants, but they do us no harm. Let them come,
anyway.” The answer to this throws the burden of
proof upon the restrictionist, and makes it incumbent
upon him to show that immigration really injures the
United States.</p>

<p class='c010'>The positive arguments against immigration as at
present conducted may be grouped under eight main
heads, which may be designated as follows: (1) the
numbers argument; (2) the distribution argument;
(3) the standard of living and wages argument; (4)
the pauperism and crime argument; (5) the stimulation
argument; (6) the illegal entrance argument; (7) the
biological argument; (8) the assimilation argument.
In the discussion of these arguments it must be borne
in mind that they are considered with reference to immigration
as it now exists, not as it might be under other
conditions.</p>

<p class='c010'>(1) The common argument that we have too many
immigrants is really no argument at all. There cannot
be too many immigrants unless the excessive number
manifests itself in some positive evil. What the average
person who uses this argument probably means, if he
has any definite meaning in mind at all, is that there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>so many aliens coming to this country that their presence
results in one or another of the undesirable conditions
which are included in the other seven arguments.</p>

<p class='c010'>(2) In like manner the statement that immigrants are
poorly distributed is no real argument. It has been
demonstrated that there are certain excessive tendencies
toward concentration on the part of our alien population,
but unless positive evils emerge from this condition, it is
no argument against immigration.</p>

<p class='c010'>(3) The claim that immigration has lowered the wages
and standard of living of the American workman has
already been examined, with the conclusion that it would
be nearer the truth to say that it has kept them from
rising. This, however, amounts to practically the same
thing. If somebody prevents me from getting that to
which I am entitled, he to all intents and purposes makes
me suffer deprivation. The evidence on this point is so
strong that it can hardly be gainsaid. As we have seen,
practically all careful students admit it. About the
only answer that can be made to this argument is that it
is not the immigrant’s fault.<a id='r351'></a><a href='#f351' class='c018'><sup>[351]</sup></a> This is undoubtedly true,
partly at least. The immigrant has no grudge against
the American workman, nor any desire to injure him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>Undoubtedly he would be glad to earn as good wages as
the native, if he could. Inasmuch as he cannot, he is
not to blame if he consents to work for what he can get.
And inasmuch as his wages are low, and his family is
large, and he is anxious to save, he is not to blame if he
lives on a miserably low standard. In the whole procedure
the immigrant may display the most admirable
qualities. He is simply playing his part in an impersonal
struggle for existence. But the result to the American
workman is the same. It is a question of causes and
effects, not of blame. It must be accepted as a fact
that each successive wave of immigration has tended to
check the advance of the laboring men already in the
country, be they native or foreign. And here is where
the numbers argument applies. For it is obvious that
the greater the numbers the more aggravated will be the
evils of this kind.</p>

<p class='c010'>(4) The argument that immigration increases the
amount of pauperism and crime in the country has already
been examined. As far as the past is concerned
it appears that pauperism has been immensely increased
through our foreign-born population, while the amount
of crime has not. But there has been a change in the
character of crime, in the direction of an increase in
crimes against the person relative to crimes against
property. What the future will bring forth, it is impossible
to predict. It seems likely that the tendency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>toward an excess of pauperism on the part of the foreign-born
will become greater as the average length of residence
of the newer immigrants increases. Here, again,
the claim that it is not the immigrant’s fault might be
advanced, and the answer be made that whether it is the
fault of the immigrant, or of our industrial system, or
of the individual American, makes no difference in the
facts as they exist. It does make a difference, of course,
as to where the remedy must be applied.</p>

<p class='c010'>(5) The extent to which the immigration movement of
the present is a stimulated one has already been indicated.
It might seem at first that it made no difference to the
United States whether the immigrant was induced to
come, or whether he came of his own volition. But a
closer consideration shows that there is a fundamental
difference. A strictly natural immigration would mean
that immigrants came in response to some actual economic
demand in this country which was strong enough
to make itself felt abroad. They would also be the ones
best fitted to meet that demand. But when one of the
greatest motives back of immigration is the desire of the
transportation companies to make money, the mere fact
of emigration is no indication of any real need for the
immigrant in this country, nor of his fitness to enter
into its life.</p>

<p class='c010'>(6) Owing to the very strict wording of our contract
labor law, a very large proportion of our immigrants
enter the country under the impression, either false or
correct, that they are evading the law. This has a very
serious effect upon their character, and upon their attitude
toward American institutions. They may readily
conceive that a country that has such laws that it is
necessary to break them to get in, probably has other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>laws that need to be broken after one is in. The whole
system engenders a most dangerous attitude of indifference
or hostility to law.</p>

<p class='c010'>(7) The biological argument of the restrictionist is
the obverse of the biological argument of the pro-immigrationist,
and is equally vague in the present state of our
knowledge on the subject of race mixing. Those who
urge this argument against immigration are those who
believe that only when the mingled races are closely allied
is the resulting stock of a superior type, or else those
who hold the extreme view that no mixed race is as good
as a pure race. At any event, they believe that the
racial elements which are now coming to the United
States are too diverse to produce anything but an inferior
stock through their interbreeding. In this connection
it should be observed that there are two possible
results of this gathering of races in the United States,
each with its own problems. One is that these races
will, in the course of time, become so blended through
intermarriage as to produce one composite but homogeneous
whole—the new American people. The other is
that race prejudice and the forces of segregation will
result in the growth of a large number of ethnic groups
within the nation, each with its own peculiarities, and each
distinct from the others. There are some indications
which point to the latter as the more probable outcome.<a id='r352'></a><a href='#f352' class='c018'><sup>[352]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>(8) The charge that our immigrants are not completely
assimilated, or are not assimilated at all, is one
of the most frequent and gravest complaints made
against our present immigration situation. It is made to
include—as, indeed, it rightfully does in a sense—all
the other arguments against immigration. The term
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>assimilation is almost unfailingly suggested by the mere
mention of immigration. But assimilation is a big word,
and needs to be used with great caution and understanding.</p>

<p class='c010'>In its general application, assimilation is defined as
the “act or process of assimilating, or bringing to a
resemblance, conformity, or identity,”<a id='r353'></a><a href='#f353' class='c018'><sup>[353]</sup></a> or “the act or
process of making or becoming like or identical; the act
or process of bringing into harmony”;<a id='r354'></a><a href='#f354' class='c018'><sup>[354]</sup></a> or again, “the
action of making or becoming like; the state of being
like; similarity, resemblance, likeness;&#160;... the becoming
conformed to; conformity with.”<a id='r355'></a><a href='#f355' class='c018'><sup>[355]</sup></a> It is evident
from these definitions that the essence of assimilation
is likeness or conformity; this of necessity implies a
type to which such likeness approaches. It appears
that it would not be incorrect to speak of assimilation
when there is nothing more than resemblance; it seems
equally clear that <i>complete</i> assimilation involves identity.
This is particularly evident in reference to the special
application of the term, which is the one generally in
mind when it is used, viz. the assimilation of food in
the body. In this sense the process is described as “the
reformation of biogen molecules by those already existing,
aided by food-stuffs.”<a id='r356'></a><a href='#f356' class='c018'><sup>[356]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>It is this physiological analogy which underlies the
term assimilation when applied to population, and the
whole matter may be best understood by keeping that
analogy in view. When nutriment is taken into the
system of a living organism, it passes through certain
processes by which it ultimately becomes an integral
part of the physical body of that organism. It is then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>said to be assimilated. Every suggestion of separate
origin disappears, each new constituent entering harmoniously
into relation with the others, new and old,
and fulfilling its own functions. While it is true that
certain food elements contribute particularly to certain
portions of the organism, yet the whole is a coördinated
unit. Any portion of the food which created disturbance
with reference to the body would not be said to be
assimilated.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is only an analogy, and analogies are dangerous
if used as arguments. But it may contain a helpful suggestion.
Transferred to the field of population, it means
that true and complete assimilation of the foreign elements
in the United States involves such a complete
transformation and unification of the new constituents
that all sense of difference between the new and the old
completely disappears. The idea of a type, into conformity
with which the new elements must be brought,
is here present also. In the case in point, this is manifestly
the “American type.” Just what this is, it might
be difficult to say. Some writers appear even to question
its existence. But the very idea of assimilation presupposes
a type. In general terms, this type in the
United States is the “native American.”<a id='r357'></a><a href='#f357' class='c018'><sup>[357]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>A foreigner, or the descendant of a foreigner, can be
truly said to be assimilated only when the natives around
him are conscious of no feeling of alienation on account
of his origin, and when the newcomer himself feels no
degree of separateness, nor possesses divergent interests
or loyalties traceable to the source from which he came.
This is not inconsistent with the fact that certain elements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>contribute more fully to specific characteristics
of the body politic than others. The political, religious,
or artistic aspects of the national life may, in fact, owe
their character more to one element of the population
than to another. But if assimilation is complete, there
can be no disturbances or friction arising from differences
of origin among the members of the nation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps the most efficient test of entire assimilation
is that of free intermarriage. If marriage might take
place between any man and woman in the country,
without suggesting differences of race or ethnic origin
to either contracting party, or their families, it is a safe
evidence of complete assimilation. There may be objections
on the grounds of wealth, social station, or
religion; there must be none based on race.</p>

<p class='c010'>This may seem like strong doctrine. It may, indeed,
not be necessary for the welfare of the country that assimilation
should be so thoroughgoing as this. It is
possible that different racial groups within the body
politic do not constitute a menace. But if so, the fact
should be stated by saying that complete assimilation is
not necessary, rather than by saying that the absence of
serious difficulties or evils arising from a composite population
is a proof of complete assimilation.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is disheartening to note the frequency with which
even careful writers on the subject accept trivial and
superficial indications as evidence of the assimilation of
our foreign residents. The wearing of American clothes,
the laying of carpets on the floors, the abandonment of
sleeping in the kitchen and taking large numbers of
boarders, the use of better food, and most of all the
knowledge of English are taken as proofs of assimilation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not all of these improvements, to be sure, are in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>themselves trivial. They may indicate a great advance
in living conditions, and in so far an approach to Americanization;
but they are superficial as proofs of assimilation.
Particularly is this true of the knowledge of English,
upon which so much emphasis is laid, and which is
often accepted as an evidence of essential assimilation.
Now the knowledge and use of the English language
is of the greatest importance, and is one of the first
steps—perhaps the most essential one—toward assimilation.
But it is not assimilation itself. Missionaries
in China, Turkey, and other foreign lands learn
to speak the languages almost perfectly, and sometimes
their children speak the language of the country more
readily than they do English. But that is no proof that
either the missionaries or their children are assimilated
into the nations in which they reside. The outlook for
foreign missions would indeed be dark, were it so. The
importance of the knowledge of English to our foreign
residents must not be underemphasized. The lack of it
is an almost insuperable bar to assimilation. But the
two should not be confused. Even people whose native
tongue is English may need to go through a process of
assimilation before they become Americans. The following
incident may serve as an illustration of this point.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two young men, one an American and the other an
Englishman, both teachers in a foreign city, were discussing
the conditions in the armies of their native lands.
The Englishman remarked that in his country the
officers were chosen from the noble families, and that it
was a fine system, as it caused the men to look upon their
superiors with great respect. The American replied
that in America officers were chosen for bravery, ability,
or distinguished conduct, and that made the men respect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>them much more. “Oh, no,” said the Briton, “it is
impossible that such a system as that could result in as
profound a respect as exists in our army.” The point
was argued for half an hour, with naturally not the
slightest alteration of opinion on either side. It is probable
that that young Englishman might have lived all
the remainder of his life in the United States, without
actually getting the American point of view. But until
he did, in this respect as well as others, he could not be
said to be truly assimilated, although he might have
been a very useful citizen.<a id='r358'></a><a href='#f358' class='c018'><sup>[358]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Regarding the matter of assimilation from the American
point of view, there are two questions to be asked.
First, are our immigrants being thoroughly assimilated?
Second, is complete assimilation necessary or desirable?
As to the first of these queries, it seems that there can be
but one answer, as far as the immigrants themselves—those
of the first generation—are concerned. We
have seen in how large a proportion of this class the
first step, the mastery of the English language, has not
been taken. In the various other conditions of life,
which we have studied, it is apparent that a large part
of the foreign-born are very far from American standards.
With length of residence, an approach to Americanization
is made. Yet it is very doubtful if it is possible for
even the most exceptional adult immigrant, from the
southeastern European races, at least, to become thoroughly
assimilated in his lifetime. The barriers of
race, set for the most part by Americans, can hardly be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>broken down. The immigrant is still an Italian, or a
Slav, or a Greek, as long as he lives, and Americans regard
him as in a measure a stranger, no matter how cultivated,
or wealthy, or broad-minded he may be. The
mental habits, also, which are the result of long race
inheritance, are very deep-seated, and can hardly be
altered even after a long residence in a foreign country.<a id='r359'></a><a href='#f359' class='c018'><sup>[359]</sup></a>
Assimilation for the adult means the abandonment of one
set of mores and the adoption of another. But the mores
of a race become too thoroughly ingrained into individual
character and thought to be subject to complete
revision in a changed environment, even under the most
favorable circumstances. And when attention is directed
to the slums, the question of assimilation becomes almost
a mockery. These matters are so obvious as to be almost
an axiom, and even the adherents of the “liberal”
policy of immigration have come to lay little stress in
their arguments upon the assimilation of the first generation.
The attention of all is turned to the children of the
foreign-born—the immigrants of the second generation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Judged by the superficial tests upon which reliance is
generally placed, the native-born children of foreign
parents seem to be very well assimilated. They wear
American hats, clothes, and shoes, they speak English,
they are as literate as the offspring of native parents of
the same social class, they play American games when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>they are young, and engage in American business when
they grow up. In the words of Professors Jenks and
Lauck, speaking of the foreign races in the larger cities,
“Their children differ little from those of the American-born,
unless they are brought up throughout their childhood
in the race colonies,”—a weighty exception.<a id='r360'></a><a href='#f360' class='c018'><sup>[360]</sup></a>
But are they really assimilated? Are the tests which
have been enumerated above fulfilled? This is a matter
worthy of the most serious consideration, and very
difficult of determination, withal.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a very hopeless task to attempt to decide upon the
degree of assimilation of any group on a statistical basis.
Statistics which might give light are meager and unreliable,
and it is not a matter which lends itself well
to such treatment at best. In many of the statistics
which might be appealed to, the second generation of
immigrant is included under the general head of the
native-born, and sometimes gives that class a more unfavorable
appearance than it would otherwise present.
As far as the statistics of criminality and tendency to
pauperism are concerned, the native-born of foreign
parents appear to be the most troublesome class in the
population. They seem to have earned an unfortunate
reputation for lawlessness, although their crimes, as the
Immigration Commission has pointed out, tend to resemble
those of the native element in character. But these
things alone are not sufficient tests of assimilation. We
need to know whether in their mental processes, in their
attitude toward life, and in their position in regard to
political or moral questions, there linger peculiarities
traceable to their foreign origin. We need to know
whether their neighbors, of the old American stock,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>think of them as different from themselves, because of
race. We need to know whether, in respect to international
questions, their views are colored by inherited
affiliations or prejudices. In regard to such considerations
as these it is impossible to make any positive and
sweeping statements. It seems wholly probable that
there are large numbers of the descendants of immigrants,
particularly of the earlier races, who would measure up
to the full standard of assimilation even by these tests.
But it seems also beyond question that there are great
bodies of immigrants of the second generation who are
prevented from complete absorption into the body
politic, if not by their own lack of adaptation, at least
by the attitude of the representatives of the old American
stock.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would be foolhardy to deny that, at the present
time, there are immense unassimilated elements in our
population,—immigrants of the first or second generation,
possibly even of the third. Every foreign-American
society, be it Irish, German, Italian, Slovak, or any
other, whatever its aims and purposes, is a standing
evidence of a group of people who recognize certain
affiliations or loyalties which are foreign to the out-and-out
American. The number of such organizations is
legion, and the membership, if it could be reckoned, would
reach an imposing total. The recent protests by Irish-American
societies against the production of certain
plays by the Irish Players, the German-American demonstration
which broke up the peace meeting in Carnegie
Hall on December 12, 1911, as well as the German-American
meetings held four years previously to protest
against the enforcement in New York of what was
styled a Puritan Sunday, the discrimination of the Russian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>government against certain of our citizens—these
and a host of similar events occurring from time to time
emphasize the existence within this country of racial
contingents which have not become indistinguishably
blended into the American people. If, for any conceivable
reason, the United States should be drawn into
any European international complication, she would
find that hosts of her citizens, as well as mere residents,
displayed a divided allegiance, of which the preponderance
might easily be on the side of some foreign nation.
As long as such conditions as these prevail, it is idle to
claim that assimilation is complete.</p>

<p class='c010'>Assimilation is a matter of the force of environment
pitted against that of heredity. The protracted discussion
as to the relative influence of these two factors
continues unsettled. But the claim that the second
generation of immigrants are thoroughly assimilated
seems to deny the importance of either. To assert that
the children of foreign parents, brought up in a home
made by foreigners though located in the United States,
are in the end equally American with children born of
native parents, and reared in a home upon which the
American type is indelibly stamped, is to claim that
heredity is of no account whatever, and that the only
environment which has weight is that rather vague
environment of “country.” It is to say that a man’s
character is solely the result of the region in which he
lives, without reference to either birth or breeding. It
seems hardly credible that such an assertion should be
seriously made. It is more likely that those who say
that the children of the foreign-born are assimilated
really mean that they are nearly enough assimilated
for all practical purposes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>Professor Franz Boas, in his study of “Changes in
the Bodily Form of Descendants of Immigrants,” which
forms a part of the report of the Immigration Commission,
and has attracted wide attention, lays much stress
on the change in environment which follows immigration.
He reaches the conclusion that there is a tendency
manifest in the American-born children of immigrants
to approach a common physical type in this country,
and that this tendency becomes more marked as the
mother’s length of residence in the United States, previous
to the birth of the child, increases. His main
investigations are concerned with the head form, and
have to do particularly with Sicilians and east European
Hebrews. The cephalic index has always been considered
one of the most permanent of race characters,
but Professor Boas’s figures seem to show that the naturally
long-headed Sicilians tend to become less so in this
country, while the relative length of head of the naturally
brachycephalic Hebrews increases. The results
reached by Professor Boas are somewhat startling, and
challenge attention. It is to be hoped that they will be
subjected to the most careful scrutiny by anthropologists
qualified either to verify or to correct them. Until
they have been thus tested they can be accepted only
tentatively. On the face of them they suggest certain
weaknesses or limitations. In the first place, they are
concerned with too few races, and too few individuals
in each race, to justify general conclusions. Again,
they are concerned almost wholly with persons under
twenty years of age, who are naturally still in a plastic
state. It would be much more significant if it could be
shown that this tendency still persisted after the individuals
were fully matured. Furthermore, the curves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>show a decided tendency to lose their regularity, and go
to pieces, in the upper ages tabulated, either because
there were too few individuals in those age groups to
afford regularity, or because the tendencies actually
diminish as age advances. Finally, it must be said that
if the mere change of residence from eastern Europe or
southern Italy to America is sufficient to produce a
complete change of head form in the offspring, it can
only mean that after all the head form is not such a permanent
race character as has been supposed, and really
has little significance. Certainly we should avoid such
sweeping deductions from this study as Professors Jenks
and Lauck make in the statement, “If these physical
changes are so great, we may well conclude that the whole
mental and even the moral constitution of the people
may also rapidly change under the new conditions.”<a id='r361'></a><a href='#f361' class='c018'><sup>[361]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>It will not do to assume, as is sometimes done apparently,
that mere residence in the United States is
enough to make Americans of foreign immigrants or
their children. America is something more than merely
a section of the earth’s surface. It is a set of standards,
customs, ideals, institutions, mores, embodied and personified
in a group of people. Like many other of the
deepest things in life they would be very hard to enumerate
or describe, yet their existence is none the less sure.
They are exemplified more completely in some persons
than in others, and he who most thoroughly personifies
them is the truest American. Historically, they have
been associated with a certain physical strain, with which
many of them appear to be inherently connected. Real
assimilation means adoption into this spiritual inheritance.
The only way it can be brought about is through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>close, intimate, constant association with those in whom
it is embodied.</p>

<p class='c010'>The agencies of assimilation then, in addition to the
physical one of race blending, are those things which
further contact and association between the newcomer
and those who are truly Americans. Professors Jenks
and Lauck give a list of such causes or influences.<a id='r362'></a><a href='#f362' class='c018'><sup>[362]</sup></a> The
list might perhaps be amplified, but as it stands it is an
enumeration of forces which contribute to interrace
association. It is not essential that the influence of the
American upon the immigrant be an intentional, or
even a conscious, one. Many of the most powerful
forces are unobserved. The foreigner is very much
aware of the differences between himself and his American
neighbors, and the laws of imitation work strongly.
But to have these forces work, there must be contact.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under the modern conditions which surround the immigrant
this contact or association is all too often wholly
lacking, or very meager. The entire life of many of our
foreign-born and the youth of their children is spent
in compact colonies, where, except for a few externals,
the atmosphere is much more suggestive of the old world
than of the new. The conditions of the old home are reproduced
with the utmost possible fidelity, though often
with a loss of much of the charm. So far as there is any
social life, it is almost wholly confined within the boundaries
of race. Even in the industrial life of to-day, as
has been pointed out, there is practically no contact
with Americanizing influences. It is really a wonder
that the aliens are Americanized at all. When we stop
to consider that in Massachusetts and New Jersey there
are only two natives for every foreigner, and that many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>of these natives are of foreign parentage, we realize how
slight are the chances for assimilation. It would be
almost the task of a lifetime for two Americans to
thoroughly Americanize a native peasant from a backward
district of southeastern Europe, if they gave their
whole time to it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The one great assimilative agency, which is continually
cited as the hope of the coming generation of the
foreign-born, is the American public school. It certainly
is a tremendous force in the right direction, and
its possibilities are immeasurable. Yet even the public
school is not a panacea for all ills. It cannot take the
place of both birth and home training. During the
hours that the pupils are in school, a wise and tactful
teacher can instill many of the principles of Americanism
into their minds. But the means, good as it is, is not
adequate to the end. And it is to be feared that under
recent conditions even the public schools are losing some
of the power in this direction that they once had. With
the growth of localized colonies of a single race, or of several
foreign races, the schools in many of our large cities
are losing their American character, as far as the pupils
are concerned, so that the immigrant child finds himself
associating with others equally foreign with himself,
instead of with children from American families. There
is a story that in a certain New England city, of high
scholastic traditions, an American lady determined to
place her son in the public school, and on taking him
down found that he was the only American child in
that school. A Russian Jewess edged up to her and
remarked confidentially, “Ain’t it a shame, the way
the Dagoes are crowding in everywhere these days?”
Furthermore, a very large proportion of the children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>of the foreign-born do not receive even such Americanizing
influence as the public school exerts, because of
the religious prejudices which compel them to attend
parochial schools.</p>

<p class='c010'>Aside from the characteristics of the immigrants
themselves, the positive forces which prevent or retard
assimilation may be considered under three heads, viz.
the indifference, love of wealth, and race prejudice of the
older residents of the United States. As to the first of
these, no elaboration is required. The attitude of those
who are perfectly content to let things drift along as
they will, without any care on their part, is too familiar
and too well understood to need comment. The love
of wealth manifests itself as a barrier to assimilation,
in two principal ways. First, the greed for economic
gain results in bringing in continually cheaper supplies
of labor, represented by ever lower and more backward
races, and paying them such wages as of necessity keep
them on the lowest scale of living. Secondly, the well-developed
distinctions between the rich and the poor
prevent Americans from associating on friendly terms
with these same foreigners for whose presence and condition
they are at least indirectly responsible. The
growing tendency for certain occupations of the lower
type to become the especial province of certain foreign
races, as has been observed above, is continually accentuating
these distinctions.</p>

<p class='c010'>There can be little doubt that race prejudice is the
greatest single barrier to assimilation. It is a disgraceful
anomaly that the people of the United States, who preach
and profess to believe in the doctrine of universal brotherhood,
who have given political equality to the negroes,
who proclaim all men born equal, should in their lives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>exemplify the narrowest race prejudice. The very currency
of the terms, “Dago,” “Sheeny,” “Griner,”
“Hunkie,” “Bohunk,” “Guinea,” “Wop,” etc., however
insulting to the people addressed, is more of a shame to
those who use them. Many of the sincerest efforts
toward a better understanding between races are thwarted
by this feeling. Ministers who try to attract the foreigners
to their churches find that their old parishioners
do not wish to associate with them—though quite
willing to foot the bills—and do not wish their children
to mingle with them in Sunday school. The fact that a
certain perfectly natural fastidiousness contributes to
this result does not in the least lessen the problem. All
praise is due to such broad-minded persons as Professor
Steiner and Miss Addams, who are doing all in their
power to break down this barrier. But their task is a
hard one.</p>

<p class='c010'>In addition to the race prejudice existing between
Americans and foreigners, there is an even more bitter
prejudice existing between various foreign groups, as
has been mentioned already. This is also a most serious
obstacle in the way of assimilation. One of the first to
cry, “Down with the foreigners,” is the Irishman.<a id='r363'></a><a href='#f363' class='c018'><sup>[363]</sup></a> In
this connection it has been pertinently pointed out that
it is possible for foreign races to become so far assimilated
as to be in practical harmony with Americans, and yet
to be seriously at variance among themselves.<a id='r364'></a><a href='#f364' class='c018'><sup>[364]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>It must be confessed that, under present conditions,
the outlook for the complete assimilation of our foreign
population, even in the second generation, is far from
bright. Even Miss Balch’s thoughtful and sympathetic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>chapter on assimilation, though written in an optimistic
spirit, makes it plain that there are many and grievous
difficulties, and leaves one with a somewhat gloomy
feeling at the close. Professor Sumner used to say that
the United States had no claim to the name of nation,
because of the diverse population elements—foremost
among them the negro—which it contains. Exception
may be taken to so narrow a conception of the term
“nation.” But there can be no question as to the fact
that the problem of maintaining national solidarity is
immeasurably complicated by the great variety of ethnic
constituents with which the United States has to deal.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are, of course, countless institutions and agencies,
of a benevolent or philanthropic nature, which are
consciously working to assimilate the immigrant. Such
are the night schools, the social settlements, the religious
missions, the boys’ clubs, etc. Conscientious efforts of
this kind, when wisely directed, are worthy of the fullest
commendation and support. But the extensive and
valuable work they are doing must not be allowed to
obscure the fact that such agencies, at best, can only
touch the border of the problem. Just as philanthropy
is inadequate to abolish poverty or to do away with the
evils of factory employment, so it is inadequate to secure
the assimilation of the immigrants in this country.
Such immense problems can be met, if at all, only by
profound and sweeping changes in the conditions of
life. The whole aim of social legislation is to remedy the
conditions of employment, and to regulate the relations
between workman and employer, so as to reduce the need
of philanthropy to a minimum. So it is vain to hope for
the assimilation of the alien as a result of conscious,
benevolent effort. The only possibility of accomplishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>such assimilation is through such a change in the
conditions of life of the immigrant, that Americanization
will inevitably and naturally result from the unconscious
and normal influences which surround him in the daily
routine of his existence.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the event of failure of assimilation to the American
type, there seem to be two possibilities, as mentioned
above. One, the development of a new, composite race,
with a character all its own; the other, the growth of a
number of separate racial groups in the same territory.
There are some who regard the latter outcome as the
more desirable of the two.<a id='r365'></a><a href='#f365' class='c018'><sup>[365]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>As to the question whether complete assimilation is
desirable or necessary from the point of view of the
United States, there is little ground for argument. If a
person sincerely holds the opinion that neither of the two
eventualities mentioned in the foregoing paragraph is
unfortunate or undesirable, his opinion could hardly be
changed by any amount of argument. Another individual,
who believes that such an outlook, on the face
of it, is ominous, is likely to remain of the same opinion
still, no matter how much logic is brought up on the other
side. The appeal to history is not fruitful, for two
main reasons. First, it can be used equally by the adherents
of either side. Montesquieu is often quoted as
saying that the fall of Rome was due to the heterogeneity
of its population, while on the other hand it has been
asserted that the strength of Rome, as well as of all
other great empires, was due to the mixture of population
elements, even from the very lowest sources.<a id='r366'></a><a href='#f366' class='c018'><sup>[366]</sup></a> The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>opposing camps in the mixed race controversy are evidently
ranged on opposite sides of this question. Secondly,
as has been pointed out, immigration is distinctly
a modern movement, and history furnishes no parallels,
but only more or less remote analogies.</p>

<p class='c010'>The opinion of the average American citizen, based
perhaps upon prejudice or conviction, rather than reasoning
or investigation, is probably that a certain degree of
assimilation is essential to the welfare of the American
nation, and that the nearer the approach to complete
assimilation, the better. Any plan for regulating immigration,
devised to meet the wishes of the American people,
would probably have to proceed on this assumption.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is now necessary to take the opposite point of view,
and examine this whole matter from the standpoint of
the countries of source. What have been, what are likely
to be, the effects of emigration upon those nations, and
accordingly what is desirable, from their point of view,
as respects the regulation of this great movement?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XIX<br> <span class='c017'>OTHER POINTS OF VIEW</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The effects of the immigration movement upon the
countries of source are in a way much more simple than the
effects upon the United States. None of the problems
of race mixture, assimilation, varying racial inheritances,
etc., are involved. They are confined principally
to the three questions of the effect of the removal of
parts of the population, the effect of the remittances
from America, and the effect of the returned immigrant.
But while simpler, these effects are perhaps none the less
subtle than those in the United States, nor any less
difficult of prediction—for in Europe, as in America,
the effects of this great movement must be largely in
the future.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is one of the corollaries of the Malthusian theory of
population that a steady, regular emigration from a
country has no power to check the rate of increase of
population in that country. This opinion has been accepted
by many leading students of social subjects from
Malthus’ day down to the present. In fact, the general
idea was expressed as early as 1790 by an anonymous
writer in that quaint old magazine, the <cite>American
Museum</cite>. He says: “When a country is so much
crowded with people that the price of the means of subsistence
is beyond the ratio of their industry, marriages
are restrained: but when emigration to a certain degree
takes place, the balance between the means of subsistence
and industry is restored, and population thereby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>revived. Of the truth of this principle there are many
proofs in the old counties of all the American states.
Population has constantly been advanced in them by the
migration of their inhabitants to new or distant settlements.”<a id='r367'></a><a href='#f367' class='c018'><sup>[367]</sup></a>
John Stuart Mill believed that a steady emigration
was powerless to cure the ills of overpopulation.<a id='r368'></a><a href='#f368' class='c018'><sup>[368]</sup></a>
Roscher and Jannasch maintain that not only will emigration
not decrease population, but may actually make
the increase of population greater than it would otherwise
be.<a id='r369'></a><a href='#f369' class='c018'><sup>[369]</sup></a> Réné Gonnard, the French writer, says that
the fact of emigration gives a stimulus to the birth rate,
and cites Adam Smith, Malthus, Garnier, Roscher, and
De Molinari in support of the view.<a id='r370'></a><a href='#f370' class='c018'><sup>[370]</sup></a> Robert Hunter
also expresses his adherence to this opinion.<a id='r371'></a><a href='#f371' class='c018'><sup>[371]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>With the laws of population in mind we can easily
understand how this condition may result—in fact, how
it must result theoretically. Every society, in the course
of its development, reaches a balance between the means
of subsistence and the desire for reproduction. This
balance is represented by the standard of living. In a
society where the desire for reproduction greatly overbalances
the desire for comforts and luxuries, the standard
of living will be low, and the rate of increase of population
high. In a society where the appetite for material
welfare is strong, the opposite conditions will prevail.
Changing conditions present the possibility of change
either in the rate of reproduction or in the standard of
living. As we have already observed, the former is the
more flexible of the two. Particularly in static societies,
such as exist in European countries, where social positions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>have become thoroughly stratified, any gradual amelioration
in circumstances is much more likely to result in
an increased rate of population growth than in an
improved standard of living.</p>

<p class='c010'>Emigration, by <i>temporarily</i> relieving congestion to a
certain extent, offers a chance of betterment. But in
general, if the emigration is moderate, this chance is
seized by the reproductive power rather than by the
standard of living. The rate of increase of population
rises until the drain of emigration is offset, while the
standard of living remains unaltered, and the total
population continues virtually the same. The very
fact of emigration gives a sense of hopefulness to the
people, and the knowledge that there is an ever ready
outlet for redundant inhabitants causes the population
of the country to multiply more rapidly than it otherwise
would. This is the result which must reasonably
be expected to follow all regular and gradual emigration
movements.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the other hand, while the withdrawal of a more or
less uniform number of inhabitants, year by year, has
no power to reduce population, and may actually tend
to increase it, the opposite result may be achieved where
there is such a sudden and extensive removal of people
from a country, that those who remain feel a definite
and profound lightening of pressure. This must be
sufficiently immediate and widespread to produce a
sudden and significant rise in wages or fall in prices. In
such a case it may occur that, before the forces of population
have had time to fill the breach, the people may
have become accustomed to a somewhat higher standard
of living, which thereafter they may be able and inclined
to maintain.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>The peculiar sex distribution of modern emigration
probably has the effect of increasing the possibility of
reducing the population in the countries of source, out
of proportion to the actual number of emigrants, just
as it lessens the likelihood of increasing population in
the country of destination.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such is the theoretic argument as regards the effect
of emigration upon the population of a country. It
may be summed up in the words of John Stuart Mill,
“When the object is to raise the permanent condition of
a people, small means do not merely produce small
effects, they produce no effects at all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There is no lack of authoritative opinions to support
this view. In addition to those already cited, the following
may be noted. Douglas, Earl of Selkirk, in his
pamphlet on “Emigration” dated 1806, expresses his
belief that emigration does not reduce population, and
cites the Isle of Skye as a case in point. The population
of this island in 1772 was about 12,000. Between this
date and 1791, 4000 people emigrated, and at least
8000 more moved in a more gradual and less conspicuous
way to the Low Country of Scotland. Yet the population
more than kept even.<a id='r372'></a><a href='#f372' class='c018'><sup>[372]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Whelpley says, “There is no hope of an exhaustion
of supply, for the most prolific races are now contributing
their millions, and yet increasing the population of
their own countries. There is no hope of an improvement
in quality, for the best come first and the dregs
follow.”<a id='r373'></a><a href='#f373' class='c018'><sup>[373]</sup></a> Professor Mayo-Smith says, “Emigration
does not threaten to depopulate the countries of Europe.
Had there been no emigration during this century (the
nineteenth) it is not probable that the population of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>Europe would have been any greater than it is. The
probabilities are all the other way.”<a id='r374'></a><a href='#f374' class='c018'><sup>[374]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Professor Taussig, while not stating this opinion in so
many words, appears to adhere to it when he says that
without emigration Sweden and Italy would have had—not
a larger population—but either a higher death
rate or a lower birth rate.<a id='r375'></a><a href='#f375' class='c018'><sup>[375]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>If we seek for a statistical demonstration of the foregoing
argument we are confronted with the same impossibility
of securing it which has become so familiar in the
course of this work. These matters do not adjust themselves
with clocklike regularity, but operate over long
periods, and are complicated by innumerable other
factors. Even though two phenomena are shown to
operate harmoniously, it is not always possible to prove
which is cause and which effect. The declining birth
rate has been a common phenomenon in almost all
European countries during the last forty years, and
particularly during the last twenty years of the nineteenth
century.<a id='r376'></a><a href='#f376' class='c018'><sup>[376]</sup></a> An opponent of the view we are
considering could point to this fact as a contradiction of
the claim, while one on the opposite side could assert
that the decline would have been equally rapid and perhaps
more so without any emigration at all. Neither
could prove his case. Even if it could be demonstrated
that the countries which experience the largest emigration
also manifest the highest rate of increase in population,
it might be easily maintained that it was the extreme
growth of population that accounted for the large
emigration, rather than the reverse. About all that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>can be shown is that a large emigration and a high rate of
increase of population may go together. Examples of
this state of affairs are numerous.<a id='r377'></a><a href='#f377' class='c018'><sup>[377]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Of the opposite case, where a sudden and extensive
emigration has cut down population, there have been a
few historical examples, notably that of Ireland. The
population of Ireland diminished from 8,100,000 in 1841
to 6,500,000 in 1851, and 5,700,000 in 1861. Since
then it has steadily declined to 4,456,000 in 1901.<a id='r378'></a><a href='#f378' class='c018'><sup>[378]</sup></a> The
fact that the beginning of this decline was coincident
with the great exodus to America has made it customary
to explain the decreasing population by emigration.
But even in this case, it is a question whether it would
not be more accurate to assign the decrease in population
in Ireland in the middle of the nineteenth century
to the famine, rather than to emigration. The famine
was the primary fact, and had passed the death sentence
upon a large proportion of the people; emigration—to
carry out the figure—merely commuted that
sentence to exile. It furnished an outlet to thousands
who were otherwise doomed to die. It has been claimed
that Norway has lost a greater part of her population by
emigration to America than any other European country
except Ireland.<a id='r379'></a><a href='#f379' class='c018'><sup>[379]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The obvious effect of the remittances from America
is a beneficial one, inasmuch as it increases the purchasing
power of those of the peasant class who remain at home.
The immigrant in the United States who sends money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>back to Europe is earning in a country where the price
level is high and spending in a country where it is low,
which is a manifest advantage. Even though his real
wages are the same as he might command at home, as
long as there is a margin of saving his family benefits
financially by the arrangement. But in so far as this
money sent home results in an increase of the monetary
circulation in the European country, its desirability is
more questionable. The Immigration Commission notes
an increase in wages in some immigrant-furnishing sections
of southern and eastern Europe. If this were accompanied
by a corresponding rise in prices, there would
of course be no real gain. Something of this sort has
actually occurred in Greece. Several forces, among
which the remittances from America stand prominent,
have within the last few years brought the exchange
between paper and gold down nearly to par. The result
has been to diminish seriously the purchasing power of
the income of the ordinary workingman. For while large
payments are made in gold, ordinary purchases are
made in paper, so that while both money incomes and
prices have remained approximately the same, the workman
who gets his gold piece changed finds that he now
has only 108 paper drachmas or so to make his purchases
with, where ten years ago he had 160 or so.<a id='r380'></a><a href='#f380' class='c018'><sup>[380]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Even where no such disadvantageous effects can be
observed, it is a question whether it is a healthy state of
affairs for any nation to be largely supported by money
earned in another land, and sent back in a form which
gives it the nature of a gift in the eyes of the common
people.</p>

<p class='c010'>As to the effect of the returned immigrant upon his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>native country, opinions again differ. Some observers
see a great advantage accruing to European countries
from the better habits of life, the more advanced knowledge
of agricultural and other industrial methods, and
the more independent and self-reliant spirit, which the
returned immigrants bring back with them. To them,
the returned emigrant appears as a disseminator of new
ideas and higher culture, and a constant inspiration to
more effective living. There are others in whose opinion
the evil influences exerted by the returned immigrant
largely outweigh the good. While they build better
houses, and wear better clothes, they are idle and egoistical.
They take no active interest in the life of those
around them, and make no effort to spread among their
fellows the advantages of what they have learned in
America. Their example arouses feelings of discontent
and restlessness among their neighbors, and leads to
further emigration, rather than to the betterment of
conditions at home. They are misfits in the old environment.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is undoubtedly much of truth in both of these
opinions, and numerous cases might be found to illustrate
either. A very helpful idea of the two-sided aspect
of this matter may be gained by studying a concrete
case, furnished by a single country. For this purpose,
excellent material is furnished by the careful study of
“The Effect of Emigration upon Italy” made by Mr.
Antonio Mangano,<a id='r381'></a><a href='#f381' class='c018'><sup>[381]</sup></a> who has gone into all the divisions
of his subject in an admirable way.</p>

<p class='c010'>This author finds that emigration, great as it has been,
has not decreased the population of Italy, which, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>the contrary, is larger than ever. He does not say that
the rate of increase has been as great as it would have
been without emigration, nor could this be proved. It
is certain that some sections of Italy have been seriously
depopulated, though the population of the country as a
whole has increased. It is quite possible that emigration
from Italy at the present time approaches the sudden
and sweeping type sufficiently so that it may
actually check the rate of increase of population.</p>

<p class='c010'>As to the effects of the money sent home, and the
returned immigrants, he finds contrary opinions, and
facts on both sides of the case. Among the beneficial
results of emigration he finds that wages have increased
fifty per cent, so that the peasants who remain have benefited
by the departure of others. Farm machinery has
been introduced, usury has almost disappeared, and the
percentage of violent crimes has been reduced. The returned
immigrant carries himself better, dresses better,
and has a greater spirit of independence, which he communicates
to others. There has arisen a growing demand
for rudimentary education. Many peasants have been
enabled to buy land.</p>

<p class='c010'>But on the other side there are many evil results to be
reckoned with. The ignorant peasant has been cheated
in the quality and price of the land he has bought, and
after two or three years of unsuccessful effort learns
that he cannot make even a living from it, and sells it at
a great loss, sometimes to the very landlord from whom
he purchased it. The southern provinces are losing their
working population, so that the production, which was
inadequate before, has become even more insufficient.
Carefully cultivated and terraced land is being laid
waste through neglect. As a result there has been a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>notable increase in prices and in the cost of living, which
nearly or entirely offsets the higher wages of the peasants,
and brings a disproportionately heavy burden on the
salaried and clerical classes. Women have been driven
to take up hard labor in the fields, to the extent that a
physical injury to the rising generation is already observable.
As a consequence of the breaking up of
families, there has been a tendency toward moral degeneracy,
not only on the part of the men who have
emigrated, but of the women who are left. Prostitution,
illegitimacy, and infanticide have increased. Children
are growing up without salutary restraint. Tuberculosis,
almost unknown in Italy before emigration, is
spreading rapidly. Only a few of the returned emigrants
are willing to settle down permanently in the old country,
and work for its uplift, and there is no assurance that the
money which has been sent to Italy for safe keeping will
be ultimately spent there. Many of the young men
who return, bring back vices with them, and serve as a
demoralizing example while they remain.<a id='r382'></a><a href='#f382' class='c018'><sup>[382]</sup></a> From the
governmental point of view, there is an alarming deficiency
of recruits for the army. Even the new houses,
built with American money, are not always an improvement
on the old, as no new ideas come in with the
remittances.</p>

<p class='c010'>A comparison of these two categories emphasizes the
fact that the favorable effects are, in general, the more
obvious and immediate ones. They are the ones which
catch the eye of the traveler or the superficial observer.
They are the ones which appear to have particularly
impressed the Immigration Commission, as evidenced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>by their seemingly hasty review of conditions on the
other side.<a id='r383'></a><a href='#f383' class='c018'><sup>[383]</sup></a> It is upon these that Professor Steiner,
with his warm fellow-feeling for the immigrant lays
special stress. Even Miss Balch gives prominence to
this class of effects. The injurious results of such a
movement as emigration are likely to be of such a nature
as makes them slow of development, and difficult to
observe and calculate. Physical and moral degeneracy
are slower to appear than high wages and new houses,
but at the same time they are more important. Taking
everything into account, it seems probable that, for Italy
at least, emigration under the present conditions will
prove at least as much of a curse as a blessing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Conditions in Greece resemble in many respects those
in Italy, though the depopulation of the country seems
even more imminent. Not only has the emigration been
very sudden, but it is almost exclusively male, so that
there seems a real danger of a serious diminution of
population in the kingdom. Although the emigration
movement is so recent in Greece that effects can hardly
yet be looked for, yet here, as in Italy, the immediate
favorable results of better houses, a reduction of the rate
of interest, mortgages cleared from the land, higher
wages and lower rates of interest are already manifest.
The darker side, too, is beginning to show in the assumption
of hard labor by the women, the lack of laborers
in certain sections, the increase of immorality among
the women, and the introduction of a demoralizing example
by returned young men. Prices and the cost of
living have increased. The returned immigrant, instead
of serving as an uplifting example of intelligent
industry, is likely so to conduct himself as to add to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>already prevalent scorn for hard work, and increase
the prevailing unrest and discontent which leads to
further emigration.<a id='r384'></a><a href='#f384' class='c018'><sup>[384]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The general conclusion in regard to the effects of
emigration upon European countries, which the facts
appear to justify, is that the movement is at least of
doubtful benefit to the countries of source.<a id='r385'></a><a href='#f385' class='c018'><sup>[385]</sup></a> The
obvious beneficial results are partially if not wholly
offset by certain undesirable consequences, insidious
and persistent in their nature, and likely to make themselves
more manifest with the passage of years. The
attitude of European governments serves as a verification
of this conclusion. It is certain that the advantages of
emigration do not sufficiently outweigh its drawbacks
in the eyes of most of these governments to lead them to
regard it otherwise than with disfavor, although none of
them now practically forbid it.<a id='r386'></a><a href='#f386' class='c018'><sup>[386]</sup></a> Nor is that attitude
due to the military interest alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>The question of the effects of immigration upon the
immigrants is perhaps the most difficult of all to determine.
It is manifest that it must affect all of their life
interests, in their own generation and for many generations
to come. And particularly, if it is desired to ascertain
whether the immigrant gains or loses in the long run by
his undertaking, the effort involves the attempt at
evaluation of almost every human activity, in order that
a balance may be struck between the good and the bad.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>On the face of it, it seems that there must be some
gain to the immigrants from immigration. It is inconceivable
that such a movement should continue year
after year unless those directly concerned in it were
profiting thereby. It is true, to be sure, that there is
a vast deal of misinformation, and false hope, on the part
of the immigrants. Those who are interested in their
coming strive to paint the future in the brightest possible
colors, and to minimize the drawbacks. The example
of one or two eminently successful acquaintances
is likely to wholly outweigh that of many who only scrape
along or fail altogether. Nevertheless, making all allowances,
it seems necessary to believe that there is a net
margin of advantage in the long run. It is perhaps possible
that this advantage may often be more specious
than real, and that the immigrant may believe himself
the gainer when, if he could balance true values,
he would find himself in a more pitiable case than
before.</p>

<p class='c010'>The great gain of the immigrant is to be looked for in
the field of wealth, or material prosperity. There can
be little doubt that on the average the immigrant is able
to earn and save more, not only of money, but of wealth
in the broader sense, than he could at home. This is
the great underlying motive of modern immigration, and
if it were illusory, the movement must soon fail. A
comparison of economic conditions in Europe and
America, as far as this can be made, seems to bear this
out. Both wages and prices are lower, on the whole,
in the countries which send us most of our immigrants
than they are in the United States. But wages appear
to be proportionally lower than prices. The money
sent from America is a very real and tangible thing, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>represents a great economic advance on the part of a
large proportion of the immigrants.</p>

<p class='c010'>Doubtless, there is also somewhat of gain in independence
and freedom for many of the immigrants.
The growth of class distinctions in the United States has
not yet proceeded so far that the immigrant from Austria-Hungary
or Italy does not feel an improvement in his
social status. To be sure, the classes of population with
which the immigrant establishes this social equality in
the United States are not such as to do him the greatest
conceivable good, but a sense of heightened self-respect
and self-reliance does undoubtedly develop, nevertheless.<a id='r387'></a><a href='#f387' class='c018'><sup>[387]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Many of the immigrants, of course, forge ahead,
either because of unusual ability or exceptional good
fortune, and attain a position of advancement in every
way which would have been utterly inconceivable in
their old home. There are countless instances of prosperous
business men, eminent and respected citizens,
invaluable servants of society in this country, who could
never have been anything but humble peasants in
their home land. These shining examples attract much
attention here and abroad, and serve as valuable illustrations
of what may be accomplished under favorable
circumstances.<a id='r388'></a><a href='#f388' class='c018'><sup>[388]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>But for the bulk of the ordinary immigrants the economic
and other advantages are offset by terrible hardships
and losses. As one thinks of the broken and
separated families, often never reunited; of the depressing,
and degrading group life of men in this country;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>of religious ideals shattered and new vices acquired in
the unwonted and untempered atmosphere of American
liberty; of the frequent industrial accidents and unceasing
overstrain of the Slavs in mine and factory,
upon which they reckon as one of the concomitants of
life in America, and which sends them back to Europe
in a few years, broken and prematurely aged, but with
an accumulation of dollars;<a id='r389'></a><a href='#f389' class='c018'><sup>[389]</sup></a> of the tuberculosis contracted
by Italians in the confined life to which they
are unaccustomed, and by Greek boot-blacks in their
squalid quarters and their long day’s labors;<a id='r390'></a><a href='#f390' class='c018'><sup>[390]</sup></a> of the sad
conditions of labor in the sweatshops and tenement workrooms;<a id='r391'></a><a href='#f391' class='c018'><sup>[391]</sup></a>
of the child labor in the cranberry bogs of
Massachusetts and New Jersey;<a id='r392'></a><a href='#f392' class='c018'><sup>[392]</sup></a> of the destruction of
family life by the taking of boarders, and the heart-breaking
toil of the boarding-boss’s wife;<a id='r393'></a><a href='#f393' class='c018'><sup>[393]</sup></a> of the unremitting
toil and scant recreation, of the low wages and
insufficient standard of living, of the unsparing and niggardly
thrift by which the savings are made possible—as
one thinks of these things, which are all too common to
be considered exceptional, and compares them with the
conditions which characterize peasant life in Europe,
where many æsthetic and neighborly circumstances
tend to offset the poverty, one cannot help wondering
how large a proportion of our immigrants finally reap a
net gain in the things that are really worth while.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is useless for any individual to undertake to answer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>this question categorically for immigrants in general.
The answer rests too much upon personal opinion and estimation
of relative values. The point that needs to
be emphasized in this connection is that against the
evident and unquestioned economic gain of most, and the
general social and intellectual gain of many, there must
be set off a long list of serious, though not always obvious,
evils which result for a large proportion of the immigrants
under present conditions.</p>

<p class='c010'>The question of the desirability of immigration from
the point of view of humanity as a whole, as previously
stated, is a summation of the aspects of the problem
from the point of view of the United States, the countries
of source, and the immigrants. This balance must be
struck by every student for himself. The effort has
been made in the foregoing pages to set forth the facts
which condition this great movement at the present
time, as a groundwork upon which reasonable conclusions
may be based. It has appeared that for the United States
there is at present no real need of further immigrants,
and that the most that can be said is that they do no
harm. On the other hand, it seems likely that the evil
effects from the movement as at present conducted—effects
to be developed mainly in the future rather than
existent at the present time—will overbalance any good
that may result. From the point of view of European
countries, while the advantages are obvious, it appears
that there are also fundamental drawbacks which may
in the end more than offset the gain. For the immigrant
there is an undoubted net margin of advantage on the
average; but this advantage is less general and real
than is often supposed, and is qualified by many weighty
considerations. In striking this balance it is important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>to bear in mind the influence of emigration and immigration
upon total population. If it is true that immigrants
in a large measure are supplanters of native
population, rather than additions to population, it then
becomes a question whether the immigrants as a body
are happier than the native population would have been,
which would otherwise have filled their places.</p>

<p class='c010'>In regard to national prosperity and welfare, moreover,
it must ever be remembered that the effects of
immigration upon all countries concerned, particularly
upon the receiving country, are scarcely more than in
the embryo. Such a tremendous movement as this
must inevitably have significant and far-reaching results.
But only a prophetic vision could state with
assurance what those results will be.</p>

<p class='c010'>One thing, however, seems certain—that the movement
is not accomplishing all the good that it might.
Many of the foregoing statements in regard to immigration
have been qualified by the phrase “as at present
conducted.” The peculiar circumstances which have
given rise to the immigration movement certainly contain
possibilities of great advantage to the human race.
It ought to be possible so to utilize them as to bring
about a great and permanent uplift for the whole of
mankind. There is no assurance that our present
policy, adopted in its main features at a time when conditions
were radically different,<a id='r394'></a><a href='#f394' class='c018'><sup>[394]</sup></a> guarantees this uplift in its
maximum degree. What, then, ought to be done about
it? This is the real kernel of the immigration problem
for the statesman and the practical sociologist.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the great difficulties with which sincere social
workers have to contend in almost every field of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>efforts is that practical economics has advanced so much
more rapidly than practical sociology. Our knowledge
of the technique of production and transportation,
and of the industrial arts, has made phenomenal strides
in the past century. The growth of cities, the development
of the factory system, easy means of communication
between all countries, the growth of the world market,
advances in agricultural methods which have made
the soil much more productive per unit of labor, have
coöperated to introduce a new set of social conditions
and problems with which we have not yet learned to
grapple. Our knowledge of how to produce satisfactory
social relations is far behind our knowledge of how to
produce wealth. This is strikingly evident in the matter
of immigration. If transportation conditions and
means of communication had remained as they were at
the time of the Revolution, our present immigration
situation could never have arisen. There would have
been a natural barrier which would have prevented too
large increments of European population from entering
the new country while it was working out its problems
and gradually finding itself. The problems of immigration
which presented themselves would have been of
sufficiently moderate dimensions so that they could
have been dealt with as they arose. As it is, the recent
rapid development of communication has made the ease
of immigration so great that we have been overwhelmed
by the resulting problems. The movement of millions
of people from one region to another is a phenomenon of
prodigious sociological import. Modern mechanical progress
has made this movement possible, before the nations
or the individuals concerned have advanced far enough
in social science to know how to make the most of it.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>Granting that there is an immigration problem, and
granting that there is a desire to grapple with it, there
are two methods of attack. The first is, to pick out
the obvious evils, and apply a specific to them one by
one. The other is to endeavor to determine the underlying
principles and to devise a consistent and comprehensive
plan which will go to the root of the matter,
relying upon established sociological laws. The first
method is much the simpler. It is the one which has
hitherto been followed out in our immigration legislation.
One by one certain crying evils have been met
by definite measures. After half a century of protest,
paupers and criminals were refused admission.
A little later contract laborers were debarred. Certain
diseased classes, growing more comprehensive with the
years, have been excluded. The principle of deportation
has been introduced and gradually enlarged. Steamship
companies have been made responsible for the return of
nonadmissible aliens. The net result of these measures
has unquestionably been beneficial. This type of remedy,
if wisely administered, is always valuable, and should
be adopted, in the absence or delay of the other kind of
solution.</p>

<p class='c010'>Certain other improvements of this general type
readily suggest themselves. The steerage should be
abolished, and United States inspectors placed on all
immigrant-carrying vessels. If possible, better provisions
should be adopted for turning back inadmissibles
early on their journey. Immigrant banks and lodging houses
should receive stricter supervision. The
padrone system and the unrestricted contract labor
system should be abolished. Tenement houses should
be supervised in the strictest way possible. Every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>remedial agency designed to better the lot of the alien
in this country should be encouraged.</p>

<p class='c010'>It appears that many of the ills of immigration are
due to faulty distribution and the lack of efficient contact
between aliens and the better classes of Americans.
Consequently, the need of better distribution, and various
schemes for securing it, are constantly urged in the
press, and in other writings on the subject. Yet we are
warned to be on our guard against pinning too much
faith to this solution of the problem. There are many
evils which distribution alone cannot remedy, and there
is competent authority for the statement that much of
the agitation for better distribution emanates from
interests which profit by a large immigration, and which
hope in this way to blind the eyes of the American
people to the more deep-seated evils, and to hush the
cry for some restrictive measures. Some think, also,
that if there ever was a time when any scheme of distribution
would have been effective, it is now long since
past.<a id='r395'></a><a href='#f395' class='c018'><sup>[395]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In such ways as the foregoing, great good may be
accomplished, and many of the more obvious evils
avoided or mitigated. It does not seem possible, however,
that in such a manner can the greatest possible good
be derived from the immigration movement. This can
be achieved only through the operation of some far-reaching,
inclusive plan of regulation, based on the
broadest and soundest principles, in which all countries
concerned will concur. The formulation of such a plan
requires the greatest wisdom of which man is capable.
It is possible that we have not yet advanced far enough
in social science to make the construction of such a plan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>feasible. In such a case, it might be the part of wisdom
and honor to radically restrict the numbers of immigrants
until such a plan can be devised and put into
operation. Otherwise, the peculiar situation of the
United States among nations may disappear, and the
possibilities of gain to the race be lost forever, before
the maximum advantage has been secured. One of the
strongest arguments for restriction at the present time is
that the United States is not yet qualified to accept the
responsibility of admitting unlimited numbers of eager
seekers for advantages, and giving them in fullest measure
those things which they desire, and which their earnest
efforts merit.</p>

<p class='c010'>One thing, meanwhile, must be remembered—the
problem will not solve itself. If there are evils connected
with immigration, there is no prospect that in
the natural course of events they will disappear of themselves.
The history of immigration has been a history
of successive waves of population, from sources ever
lower in the economic, if not in the social, scale. If it
has seemed at any time that the country was about to
adjust itself to a certain racial admixture, a new and
more difficult element has presented itself. And the
process will go on. As General Walker pointed out
long ago, immigration of the lowest class “will not be
permanently stopped so long as any difference of <i>economic
level</i> exists between our population and that of the
most degraded communities abroad.”<a id='r396'></a><a href='#f396' class='c018'><sup>[396]</sup></a> Under present
conditions a diminution in the immigration stream should
not be interpreted as a cause of congratulation, but
rather deep consternation. For, except to the extent
that restriction is actually accomplished by our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>laws, a cessation of the stream of immigration to the
United States can only mean that economic conditions
in this country have fallen to so low a pitch that it is no
longer worth while for the citizens of the meanest and
most backward foreign country to make the moderate
effort to get here.</p>

<p class='c030'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. There has not only been much looseness and ambiguity in the use of the
word “immigration,” but also an apparent feeling that immigration and emigration
are two different things, as is witnessed by the title of one of the standard
works on the subject. They are, in fact, only two different ways of looking at
the same thing. As so often happens in the social sciences, the student of immigration
is under the necessity of taking a word from the common language, and
giving it a more restricted and inflexible meaning than either everyday usage
or the etymology of the word would warrant.</p>

in this case was less grievous, however, as they were apparently bound out to
service for a term of four years, so that they did not at once come on the community.

shipmasters to furnish lists of their passengers, and prohibiting the introduction
of lame, impotent, or infirm persons, or those incapable of maintaining themselves,
except on security that the town should not become charged with them.
In the absence of this security, shipmasters were compelled to take them back
home. This statute was reënacted with amendments from time to time.

<p class='c030'><a href='#r43'>43</a>. These terms are used somewhat loosely in the contemporary documents and
in modern writings. “Indented servants” is the broader term, including all
who signed indentures, or were sold under an indenture, whether they came willingly
or under compulsion. “Redemptioners” is sometimes used to refer specifically
to those who voluntarily sold themselves. But there is authority for the
view that “redemptioner,” strictly speaking, referred to one who came without
an indenture, on the expectation of finding some one on this side who would
pay for his passage. He was given a period of time after landing to accomplish
this. Failing in this, he was to be sold by the captain to the highest bidder.
See Geiser, K. F., <cite>Redemptioners and Indentured Servants in the Colony and

<p class='c030'><a href='#r83'>83</a>. The following passage, quoted from J. T. Maguire’s <cite>The Irish in America</cite>,
gives a vivid picture of conditions on the voyage, and of the circumstances that
attended landing in Canada. “But a crowded immigrant sailing ship of twenty
years since [written in 1868], with fever on board!—the crew sullen or brutal
from very desperation, or paralysed with terror of the plague—the miserable
passengers unable to help themselves or afford the least relief to each other;
one fourth, or one third, or one half of the entire number in different stages of the
disease; many dying, some dead; the fatal poison intensified by the indescribable
foulness of the air breathed and rebreathed by the gasping sufferers—the
wails of children, the raving of the delirious, the cries and groans of those in
mortal agony!” The only provision for the reception of these sufferers at Grosse
Isle, where many of them were landed, consisted of sheds which had stood there
since 1832. “These sheds were rapidly filled with the miserable people, the
sick and the dying, and round their walls lay groups of half-naked men, women
and children, in the same condition—sick or dying. Hundreds were literally
flung on the beach, left amid the mud and stones, to crawl on the dry land how
they could. ‘I have seen,’ says the priest who was chaplain of the quarantine,&#160;... ‘I have one day seen thirty-seven people lying on the beach, crawling on the
mud, and dying like fish out of water.’ Many of these, and many more besides,
gasped out their last breath on that fatal shore, not able to drag themselves from
the slime in which they lay.” As many as 150 bodies, mostly half naked, were
piled up in the dead-house at a time. (pp. 135, 136.) The moral evils and
dangers were said to be even worse than the physical.</p>

<p class='c030'><a href='#r102'>102</a>. The subject of Chinese immigration has been treated thus summarily because
of the large amount of reliable material which is easily available on the
question. It has been treated as a whole, rather than divided among the different
periods, because in fact it has been a distinct phase of our immigration problem;
only since 1900 has the administration of the Chinese exclusion law been
a part of the duties of the Commissioner General of Immigration. Foremost
among the books on the topic is Mrs. Coolidge’s work, already quoted. A
defense of the Chinese written in the heat of the controversy is George F. Seward’s
<cite>Chinese Immigration</cite>. Interesting chapters on the topic are to be found in
Mayo-Smith, and Hall, and frequent references in Jenks and Lauck, and Commons.

<p class='c030'><a href='#r104'>104</a>. “Deportation” must be carefully distinguished from “exclusion,” “debarment,”
or “returning.” When either of the last three terms is used, it implies
that the immigrant is never allowed to land in the country. The first term
is applicable when the immigrant has landed in this country, and some time after,
in accordance with some provision of the law, is sent back to the country from
which he came.</p>

<p class='c030'>This is the first provision for deportation in the federal laws, except the temporary
provision of the Alien Bill. As early as 1837 the common council of
New York City passed a resolution, authorizing the commissioners of the almshouse
to send back to their native country such alien paupers as were, or were
likely to become, paupers at the establishment at Bellevue or elsewhere,
provided the pauper in question gave his consent. (Executive (House) Documents,
25th Cong., 2d Ses., 370, pp. 16–18.) It is amusing to note that at that period
our right to send back alien paupers,—even though they had been officially
transported to this country,—after they had once been admitted, was seriously
questioned by foreign powers.</p>

<div class='footnote c011' id='f105'>
<p class='c030'><a href='#r105'>105</a>. By an administrative rule of the department any alien, who is a lawful
resident of the United States and becomes a public charge from physical disability
arising subsequent to his landing, may, with his consent, and the approval
of the bureau, be deported within one year at government expense.</p>

<p class='c030'><a href='#r262'>262</a>. That the spirit of Know Nothingism dies hard, and is likely to crop out even
in modern times, is evidenced by the so-called A. P. A. agitation of the early
nineties. The A. P. A., or American Protective Association, was the most
prominent of several secret organizations, formed about this time, the purposes
and methods of which were strikingly similar to those of the Native American
and Know Nothing parties. The object of their antagonism was the Roman
Catholic Church, and particularly the body of Irish Catholics. This agitation
was carried to such an extent that many people, even of the intelligent and thoughtful,
feared that a religious war was impending. For details see Winston, E. M.,
“The Threatening Conflict with Romanism,” <cite>Forum</cite>, 17:425 (June, 1894);

<p class='c030'><a href='#r271'>271</a>. Professor Taussig says that there is evidence that “a standard of living so
tenaciously held as to affect natural increase” is a force which acts on the numbers
of the well-to-do in modern countries and is coming into operation in the upper
tier of manual workmen. <cite>Prin. of Econ.</cite>, Vol. II, p. 152. In these upper groups
it operates mainly upon the birth rate. In the lower groups, where there is less
conscious control of the rate of reproduction, a decrease in the means of subsistence
must almost inevitably result in an increase of the death rate, particularly
of infants.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c011' id='f272'>
<p class='c030'><a href='#r272'>272</a>. A certain amount of repetition of matter already given—particularly in the
discussion of the effects of immigration on population—has seemed unavoidable
in the following paragraphs. The matters of population, wages, and standards
of living are obviously closely associated.</p>

<div class='footnote c011' id='f274'>
<p class='c030'><a href='#r274'>274</a>. Mr. Earle Clark has shown by a comparison of recent figures that “the wages
paid in the Massachusetts cotton mills do not enable the men employed to
maintain a standard of living higher than that which the men employed in English
mills can maintain upon English wages.” <cite>The Survey</cite>, March 23, 1912.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c011' id='f275'>
<p class='c030'><a href='#r275'>275</a>. A further consideration, in addition to the difference in standards, which gives
the foreigner an advantage over the native, is found in the different price levels
here and abroad. In general the price levels in the countries from which the new
immigration comes are lower than in the United States. This means that the
immigrant, who saves part of his earnings for the support of a family in Europe,
finds it possible to accept a lower wage than the native, who supports his family
in this country, and yet keep his family on a standard equivalent to that of the
American workman.</p>

<div class='footnote c011' id='f276'>
<p class='c030'><a href='#r276'>276</a>. Professor Taussig says, “The position of common laborers in the United
States (that is, in the Northern and Western States) has been kept at its low level
only by the continued inflow of immigrants.... These constant new arrivals
have kept down the wages of the lowest group, and have accentuated also the
lines of social demarcation between this group and others.” <cite>Principles of
Economics</cite>, Vol. II, p. 139. See also p. 234.</p>

<div class='footnote c011' id='f351'>
<p class='c030'><a href='#r351'>351</a>. This point is frequently pressed by writers who adopt the standpoint of
the immigrant, as for instance, Professor Steiner. Much effort is expended to
establish the high character of the immigrant, his noble motives and worthy
ambitions. The wealthy American on the promenade deck is contrasted unfavorably
with the alien in the steerage. No criticism is to be made of this
position. It is beyond doubt that there is a great deal to admire in the very
humblest of our immigrants. But a most emphatic exception must be taken to
the conclusion which apparently is assumed to follow this premise; namely,
that therefore anything in the way of restriction is wrong. Granted that the
admirable character of the immigrant is thoroughly established. This fact does
not obviate the need for action, if it appears that evils arise. If the welfare of the
nation is menaced; if the immigrants are not reaping the benefits for which
they have sacrificed all in the old country; if the wonderful patrimony of the
United States, fitted to render an enduring service to mankind, is being thoughtlessly
squandered; if conditions in foreign countries are not improved; if the
most remarkable population movement in history is being left to the machinations
of selfishly interested parties—if any of these things are true, the fact that
it is not the immigrant’s “fault” does not remove the responsibility from those
upon whom it naturally rests of taking active measures to secure to humanity the
greatest and most enduring benefits which such a tremendous sociological phenomenon
may be made to yield. If the first step in such a conservation program is
restriction, then that step must be taken.</p>
